<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
OUT WITH THE ROYAL BUCKHOUNDS.
</h3>

<p>
'And your name is Alison,' said the
young man, looking tenderly in the
girl's eyes of soft grey-blue, that long, dark
lashes shaded.  'Yet I hear some of your
friends call you Lisette.'
</p>

<p>
'It is, I believe, the same thing&mdash;an old
Scoto-French name, long peculiar to our
family&mdash;the Cheynes of Essilmont&mdash;as papa
would say if he were here,' she added, with
a soft smile.  Then after a pause she asked,
'How did you learn, Captain Goring, that it
was Alison?'
</p>

<p>
'By looking in Debrett after I first had
the pleasure' (he had well-nigh said the joy)
'of meeting you at the General's
garden-party in Aldershot.'
</p>

<p>
This simple avowal of an interest in her
(but it might only be curiosity) caused the
girl to colour a little and nervously re-adjust
her reins, though her horse, pretty well
blown after a long run, was now going at
an easy walk, pace by pace, with the larger
and stronger bay hunter of her companion,
and she glanced shyly at him as he rode by
her side, for Bevil Goring, in his perfect
hunting costume&mdash;his coat, buckskins, and
boots, his splendid strength and engaging
debonair expression of face, his soldierly
set up, born of infantry service in India&mdash;was
all that might please a woman's eye,
however critical; and he in his turn felt that
every pulse in his frame would long beat to
the slight incidents of that day's glorious
scamper together on horseback.
</p>

<p>
Gathered into a tight coil under her
smart riding hat and dark blue veil, Alison
Cheyne's hair was of that bright and rare
tint when the brown seems to blend with or
melt into amber, and these into a warmer
tint still in the sunshine, and with which
there is generally a pure and dazzling
complexion.
</p>

<p>
'It was so kind of you, Captain Goring,'
said Miss Cheyne, after a pause, 'to invite
down papa to dine at your mess at Aldershot.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all.  Dalton, Jerry Wilmot, and
all the other fellows were most glad to see
the old gentleman.  I only fear that he
thought us rather a noisy lot.'
</p>

<p>
'It delighted him&mdash;we live but a dull life
at Chilcote.'
</p>

<p>
'And you have had two brothers in the
service, Mrs. Trelawney told me?' resumed
Goring, by no means anxious to let the
conversation drop, or his companion begin to
think of friends who might be looking for her.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;two, much older than I, however&mdash;poor
Ranald and golden-haired Ellon.'
</p>

<p>
'What a curious name!'
</p>

<p>
'It is a place in Aberdeenshire where
much of papa's property once lay.  Ranald
died of fever, and was buried in the lonely
jungle near the Jumna.'
</p>

<p>
'Illness there does its work quickly&mdash;four
and twenty hours will see the beginning and
the end, and the green turf covering all.
I have seen much of it in my time, Miss
Cheyne&mdash;often buried the dead with my own
hands, by Jove!'
</p>

<p>
'How sad to die as my poor brother did&mdash;so
far away,' said the girl, her soft voice
breaking a little.  'We have a saying in
Scotland, "May you die among your
kindred."'
</p>

<p>
'In the service one's comrades become
one's kindred&mdash;we are all brother soldiers.'
</p>

<p>
'Ellon was thrown from his horse near
Lahore, and impaled on his own sword, and
so&mdash;and so&mdash;poor papa has now only me!
I don't think he has ever got fairly over
Ellon's death, as it left the baronetcy
without an heir.  But let me not think of these
things.'
</p>

<p>
'I remember the unfortunate event of
Ellon Cheyne's death,' exclaimed Goring,
the colour gathering in his bronzed cheek.
'It occurred just close by the Cabul road,
the day after we marched in from Umritsur;
and, strange to say, I commanded the firing
party at the poor fellow's funeral, on a day
when the sky was like molten brass, and the
wind swept past us hot and stifling like the
blast from an open furnace.'
</p>

<p>
'You?' said Miss Cheyne, her eyes dilating
as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; my voice gave the orders for the
three funeral volleys.'
</p>

<p>
'How strange&mdash;and now I meet you here!'
</p>

<p>
'The world is a small place now-a-days.'
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were full of a tender interest
now, that made the heart of her companion
thrill; nor did hers do so the less that this
event caused a bond of sympathy&mdash;a subject
in common between them.
</p>

<p>
A sad expression stole over the features
of Alison Cheyne, and so regular were these,
that with the fine outline of her profile they
might have been deemed insipid, but for the
variable expression of her very lovely eyes
and sensitive mouth; and now, when flushed
with the exercise of fast riding, the
excitement of following the hounds amid such a
stirring concourse, and over such an open
country, they seemed absolutely beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Attracted by each other's society, she and
the Captain were now somewhat apart from
all the field, and the brilliant hunt was
waxing to its close.
</p>

<p>
The day was a bright and clear one early
in October, the regular opening day of the
regular season with the Royal Buckhounds.
The country wore the aspect of the month;
swine were rooting in the desolate cornfield,
eliciting the malediction of many a huntsman
as he tore over the black and rotting
stubble; geese were coming draggled and
dirty out of the muddy ponds and brooks;
the hedges looked naked and cold, and the
blackened bean sheaves that had never
ripened were rotting in the ground.  An
earthy odour came from the water-flags,
and every hoof-print was speedily filled
with the black ooze of the saturated soil the
moment it was made; but the sky was clear,
if not quite cloudless, and the sunshine
bright as one could wish.
</p>

<p>
The time-honoured meet had duly taken
place at the old village of Salthill, the
scene of that tomfoolery called the Eton
Montem, till its suppression in 1848; and we
need scarcely inform the reader that a
certain sum is devoted annually to maintain
the stables, kennels, and establishment of
the Royal Buckhounds, and that with each
change of Ministry the post of their master
is an object of keen competition among
sport-loving nobles; but the opening meet
is said to be seldom a favourite one with
lovers of hard riding.
</p>

<p>
There is always a vast 'field,' and every
one who 'by hook or crook' can procure
a mount is there.  Salthill thus becomes an
animated and pleasant spectacle to the mere
spectator, while it is a source of unmixed
excitement to all who go to hunt&mdash;perhaps
some five hundred horsemen or so, all
anxious to be first in the chase, and jostling,
spurring, and struggling to be so.
</p>

<p>
All know what a scene Paddington
Station presents a short time previous to the
meet, when the Metropolitan corps of huntsmen
begin to muster in strong force, and
well-known faces are seen on every
hand&mdash;staunch followers of 'the Queen's'&mdash;going
down by special train, the present holder of
the horn being the observed of all; and
the train, with a long line of dark
horse-boxes starting with sixty or seventy noble
horses for Slough, whence, after an eighteen
miles' run, the long cavalcade of horsemen
and people on foot pours on to Salthill,
huntsmen and whips bright in brilliant new
costumes of scarlet laced with gold, their
horses with skins like satin, and the hounds
the perfection of their breed.
</p>

<p>
There may be seen young guardsmen
from Windsor, cavalry men from Aldershot,
which is about twenty miles distant, in
spotless black and white, side by side with old
fellows in tarnished pink with the old
jockey-cap, horse-dealers in corduroys and
perhaps blucher boots; city men, and
apparently all manner of men, and here and
there a lady such as only may be seen in
the Row, perfect in her mount, equipment,
and costume.
</p>

<p>
On the adjacent road a lady's pretty little
victoria may be jammed between a crowded
four in hand and a still more crowded
costermonger's cart; and so the confusion
goes on till some well-known deer is quietly
taken away to the front; and punctually to
time the master gives the order to advance,
when the huntsmen and hounds scurry
into an open field, where the yeomen
prickers in their Lincoln green costumes have
uncarted the quarry.
</p>

<p>
Anon the line is formed, and away over
the open country stream the hounds like a
living tide, with red tongues out, and steam,
issuing from their quivering nostrils, and all
follow at headlong speed.
</p>

<p>
Here it was that Alison Cheyne, Bevil
Goring, and others of their party lost some
of their companions in the first wild rush
across a hedge with a wet ditch on the
other side.  Jerry Wilmot's saddle-girth
gave way, and he fell in a helpless but
unhurt heap on the furrows; Lord Cadbury&mdash;a
peer of whom more anon&mdash;failed utterly
to clear the hedge; and Tony Dalton, of
Goring's regiment, though a keen sportsman,
came to grief somehow in the ditch, and
thus ere long Alison Cheyne had as her
sole squire the companion we have described,
and together, after charging with many
more a gate beyond the hedge, they had a
splendid run over an open country.
</p>

<p>
Together they kept, Goring doing much
in the way of guiding his fair friend, who
though somewhat timid, and not much
practised as an equestrienne, had now given
her whole soul to the hunt, and became
almost fearless for the time.
</p>

<p>
In a pretty dense clump 'the field' went
powdering along the path through the
village of Farnham, after which the deer
headed off for Burnham Beeches, the
beautiful scenery of which has been so often
portrayed by artists and extolled by tourists;
and then, like bright 'bits of colour'
that would delight the former, the scarlet
coats could be seen glancing between the
gnarled stems of the giant trees, as the
horsemen went pouring down the woody
steeps.
</p>

<p>
'Take care here, for heaven's sake, Hiss
Cheyne, and keep your horse well in hand,
with its head up,' cried Bevil Goring.
'The tree stumps concealed here among the
long grass are most treacherous traps.'
</p>

<p>
'I fear more the boughs of the trees,
they are so apt to tear one's hair,' replied
the flushed girl, breathlessly, as she flew,
her dark blue skirt and veil streaming
behind her; and now and then a cry of terror
escaped her, as a horse and its rider went
floundering into some marshy pool, though
generally with no worse result than a mud
bath.
</p>

<p>
At length the beeches are left behind,
while the deer shoots on past Wilton Park,
anon over Chalfont Brook, till she reaches
the stable in a farmyard, and there is
captured and made safe, and so ends the day,
after which there is nothing left for the
breathless and blown, who have followed
her thus far, but to ride slowly back some
fifteen miles to Slough.
</p>

<p>
Less occupied by interest in the hunt
than with each other, Bevil Goring and
Miss Cheyne had gradually dropped out of
it, and at the time of the conversation with
which this chapter opens were riding slowly
along a narrow green lane that led&mdash;they
had not yet begun to consider in what
precise direction.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
AT CHILCOTE.
</h3>

<p>
'The hounds threw off at half-past
eleven, and the afternoon is far
advanced,' said Miss Cheyne, with a little
anxiety of manner.  'I must take the nearest
cut home.'
</p>

<p>
'Thither, of course, I shall do myself the
honour of escorting you.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;so much.'
</p>

<p>
She could not say otherwise, as she could
neither decline his escort nor with propriety
ride home alone; yet she gave a glance
rather helplessly around her, as all her
immediate friends&mdash;and one more especially,
whose escort her father wished her to have
had&mdash;were now left miles behind, having
'come to grief' at the first fence, and were
now she knew not where.
</p>

<p>
But then she thought it was not her fault
that they had dropped out of the hunt, or
out of their saddles perhaps.
</p>

<p>
'To reach the high-road, we must take
this fence,' said Captain Goring, finding that
the narrow lane they had pursued, ended
in a species of <i>cul de sac</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Not a gap, not a gate is in sight.'
</p>

<p>
'And by Jove, Miss Cheyne, it is a rasper!'
he exclaimed.  'Allow me to go first,
then follow, head up and hand low.'
</p>

<p>
He measured the distance, cleared the
fence, and came safely down on the hard
road beyond.
</p>

<p>
With a little cry of half delight and half
terror curiously mingled, the girl rushed
her horse at the fence, but barely cleared
it, as its hoofs touched the summit.
</p>

<p>
'What a nasty buck jump,' said Goring.
'Is that an Irish horse, used to double
fences, I wonder?'
</p>

<p>
'And all my back-hair has come down.'
</p>

<p>
'Glorious hair it is, below your waist and
more.'
</p>

<p>
'And all my own,' said the girl laughing,
as she placed her switch between her pearly
teeth, and with her gauntleted hands
proceeded to knot the coils deftly up; 'all
my own, by production, and not by purchase.
And now for home,' she added, as they
broke into an easy trot.  'Such a hard
mouth this animal has!' she exclaimed, after
a pause; 'my poor wrists are quite weary.'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you ride him?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not much choice.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'I owe my mount to the kindness of a
friend of papa's, to Lord Cadbury,' she
replied, colouring slightly, but with an air of
annoyance.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed,' said Goring, briefly, and then
after a pause, he added, 'you have ridden
with these hounds before.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, once when the meet was at Iver's
Heath, and again when it was at Wokingham,
and the deer was caught in a pond near
Wilton Park.'
</p>

<p>
'And did Lord Cadbury on each occasion
give you a mount?' he added, in a casual
manner.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, we have no horses at Chilcote; but
how curious you are,' she replied, colouring
again, and with a sense of annoyance that
he did not suspect, though the mention of
the peer's name by her lips irritated Bevil
Goring, and made him seek to repress the
love that was growing in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Yet he knew not that he had impressed
Alison Cheyne by his voice and manner
beyond anyone whom she had hitherto met,
but she was conscious that her heart beat
quicker when he addressed her, and that the
very sunshine seemed to grow brighter in
his presence; but to what end was all this,
she thought, unless&mdash;if he loved her&mdash;he
was rich enough to suit her father's standard
of wealth.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near Chilcote they tacitly,
it seemed, reduced the pace of their horses to a walk.
</p>

<p>
'If it does not grieve you now to recur
to the fate of your brother Ellon,' said
Goring, in his softest tone, 'I may mention
that I have a little souvenir of him, of
which I would beg your acceptance.'
</p>

<p>
'A souvenir of Ellon!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'How came you to possess it?'
</p>

<p>
'When his effects were sold at Lahore,
before his regiment marched again.'
</p>

<p>
'And this relic&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Is a ring with a girl's hair in it.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you so much,' said she, with a
quivering lip; 'but to deprive you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, do not begin to speak thus.
To whom should it belong but to you?  And
how strange is the chance that gives me an
opportunity of presenting it!'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot decline it; but the girl&mdash;who
can she have been?  Poor Ellon, some
secret is buried in his grave.'
</p>

<p>
'Soldiers' graves, I doubt not, hide many,
and many a sad romance.  I have generally
worn it, curious to say, as my stock of
jewellery is not very extensive.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you it with you now?'
</p>

<p>
'No, I never wear rings when riding, the
stones are apt to get knocked out.  I meant
to do myself the pleasure of calling on you
after the hunt; and shall, if you will permit
me.  To-morrow I am for guard.'
</p>

<p>
'For guard over what?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing,' he said, laughing.  'There is
nothing to see or to guard, but it is all the
same to John Bull.'
</p>

<p>
'The day after, then?'
</p>

<p>
'The day after.'
</p>

<p>
They were close to the house now, and,
lifting his hat, he bowed low and turned his
horse just as a groom, who had been waiting
in the porch, took hers by the bridle,
and, waving the handle of her switch to him
in farewell, Miss Cheyne gathered up her
riding skirt and entered the house.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring lingered at the further end
of the avenue that led to Chilcote, which
was in a lovely locality, especially in summer,
one of those sunny places within thirty miles
of St. Paul's, and one secluded and woody&mdash;a
place like Burnham Beeches, where the
tree trunks are of amazing size, and the
path that led to the house went down a deep
dell, emblossomed in a wilderness leafy at
all times but in winter.
</p>

<p>
The ash, the birch, and contorted beeches
overhung the slopes on each side, and there
seemed an entire absence of human care
about them; and there in summer the sheep
wandered among the tender grass, as if they
were the only owners of the domain; but
Bevil Goring had but one thought as he
looked around him, and then turned
lingeringly away.
</p>

<p>
'How delicious to ramble among these
leafy glades with her!  How deuced glad
I am that I have that poor fellow's ring,
and can gratify her&mdash;perhaps myself too.
Bother the guard of to-morrow; but I must
get it over as best I may.'
</p>

<p>
He lighted a cigar, and at a trot took the
road to Aldershot, but so sunk in thoughts
that were new and delicious that he forgot
all about his 'soothing weed' till it scorched
his thick dark moustache.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile let us follow Alison Cheyne
into her somewhat sequestered home.
</p>

<p>
She had blushed with annoyance when
resigning the reins of her horse to Gaskins,
Lord Cadbury's groom, while thinking that
there was neither groom nor stable at
Chilcote, though, as her father had told her
many a time and oft, there were stalls for
four and twenty nags at Essilmont, where
others stabled their horses now; and sooth
to tell, for causes yet to be told, she
was provoked at being under any obligation
to old Lord Cadbury, especially in
the now reduced state of their fortunes.
</p>

<p>
She was received with a bright smile of
welcome in the entrance hall by their sole
male attendant, old Archie Auchindoir, Sir
Ranald's man-of-all-work, who looked
resentfully after the unconscious groom while
taking away the horse, which he would gladly
have retained for his young mistress by
force if he could, for Archie thought
regretfully of the once ample <i>ménage</i> at far away
Essilmont, where, like his father before
him, he had grown to manhood and age in
the family of the Cheynes.
</p>

<p>
He was true as steel to his old master, to
whom, however, he sometimes ventured to
say sharp things in the way of advice; and
to the 'pock-puddings,' as he called the
denizens of the present locality, he fearlessly
said sharper and very cutting things with a
smirk on his mouth and a glitter in his keen
grey eyes, and with perfect impunity, as they
were addressed in a language to the hearers
unknown; but it gratified Archie none the
less to utter them, as he often did in the
guise of proverbs.
</p>

<p>
'Papa at home?' asked Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Miss,' said he, receiving her gloves
and switch.  'And waiting anxiously for
you, though ower proud to show it even to
me; but, my certie, it's the life o' an auld
hat to be weel cockit.'
</p>

<p>
Their household was so small now that
Alison had no maid to attend upon her, and
quickly changing her costume she sought at
once the presence of her father, smoothing
her hair with her white hands as she hurried
to receive his kiss; for, so far as he was
concerned, Alison, in her twentieth year, was
as much a child as when in her little frocks.
</p>

<p>
He was seated in a little room called his
study, though there were few books there;
but there were a writing table usually
littered with letters, and invariably with an
unpleasant mass of accounts to amount
'rendered;' an easy chair, deep, high-backed, and
cosy, in which he passed most of his time,
and which was so placed that from it he had
a full view of the long, woody, and neglected
avenue.  There he spent hours reading the
<i>Field</i> and turning over books on farming,
veterinary surgery, and so forth, by mere
force of habit, though he had not an acre of
land or a dog or a horse to look after now;
and these studies were varied by the perusal
of prints of a conservative tendency, and
an occasional dip into the pages of Burke.
</p>

<p>
He courteously threw into the fire the
end of the cigar he had been smoking as his
daughter entered, and twining her soft arm
round him said, while nestling her face in his
neck&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, I have never had so delightful
a day with the hounds as this!'
</p>

<p>
The master of a broken fortune and
impoverished household, Sir Ranald Cheyne,
baronet of Essilmont and that ilk, as he
duly figured in that year's volume of Burke
and Debrett, with a pedigree going far
beyond the first baronet of his house, who had
been patented in 1625, and duly infeft at
the Castle-gate of Edinburgh with a vast
patrimony in Nova Scotia, and 'power of
pit and gallows' over his vassals there, was
a proud and querulous man, stately in
manner and somewhat cold and selfish to all
men, save his daughter Alison, who was the
apple of his eye, the pride of his old heart,
on whose beauty, as the means of winning
another fortune, all his hopes in life were
based, and with whom he was now living in
semi-obscurity at Chilcote, a small,
venerable, and secluded mansion in Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald had a pale and worn face that
in youth had been eminently handsome; his
silver hair, or rather what remained of it,
was brushed back behind his wax-like ears,
and a smile of great tenderness for his
daughter, the last of his old, old race and
the hope of his age, lighted up his
aristocratic features.
</p>

<p>
A gold-rimmed <i>pince-nez</i> was balanced on
the thin ridge of his rather aquiline nose,
and though his bright blue eyes were smiling,
as we say, their normal expression may
be described as usually one of 'worry.'
</p>

<p>
His voice was in unison with his face&mdash;it
was worn too, if we may use the expression,
yet soft and not unmusical.
</p>

<p>
'You had an escort to the gate, I saw?'
said he, interrogatively.  'Lord Cadbury,
of course; why did he not come in?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no; I missed him in the field somewhere.'
</p>

<p>
'And your escort?'
</p>

<p>
'Was Captain Goring&mdash;you know him&mdash;from
Aldershot,' she replied, a little nervously.
</p>

<p>
'Again?' said Sir Ranald, with just the
slightest shade of displeasure flitting over his
face.  'You were safely driven to the meet
by Mrs. Trelawney?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and, when I last saw her and dear
little Netty, their victoria was wedged
between a drag and a tax-cart.  I do hope
they escaped without harm.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope so, too, for she is a very charming
woman.  And you found Cadbury duly
waiting at Salthill with his horses?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and Gaskins came here to get mine.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope you duly thanked Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, papa.'
</p>

<p>
'But why did he not make an effort to
escort you home?' asked Sir Ranald, whom
this point interested.
</p>

<p>
'I missed him in the running, as I said,
papa,' replied Alison, colouring now.  'He
is so slow at his fences.'
</p>

<p>
'Slow; he has the reputation of generally
riding faster than his horse,' said Sir Ranald,
who was unable to repress a joke at the
<i>parvenu</i> peer, whom he was not without
quiet hopes of having for a son-in-law.
'Then, I suppose, Captain Goring was your
escort for most of the day?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Alison, frankly.
</p>

<p>
'In fact, I may presume that you and he
were always neck-and-neck; taking your
fences together, and all that sort of thing?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no, papa; certainly not,' replied
Alison, thinking it was unwise to admit too
much, though her father's surmises were
very near the truth.
</p>

<p>
'I am astonished that Cadbury did not
make an effort to join you.'
</p>

<p>
'I never saw him after the hounds threw
off,' said Alison, a little wearily, as she
knew how her father's secret thoughts were tending.
</p>

<p>
'Did you look for him?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'So&mdash;so&mdash;this is exactly what happened before.'
</p>

<p>
'Can I help it, papa, if his wont is to fail
at the first fence?'
</p>

<p>
'You can help Captain Goring so
opportunely taking his place.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not quite see what his place is; but
oh, papa, what do you think?  Capt. Goring
heard of poor Ellon in India&mdash;he actually
laid him in his grave, if one may say so!'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'He commanded the soldiers who fired over it.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!' said Sir Ranald, with some
interest now.
</p>

<p>
She was about to mention the proffered
ring, which she deemed a precious relic,
when her father said with a tone of some
gravity, and even crustily&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I don't much like your following the
hounds, and think you must give it up.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, it is delightful; and if I had a horse
of my own&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'There you go!' exclaimed her father,
with a petty gush of irritation; 'I don't like
it!  Think how a girl looks in an October
morning at a cover-side, her eyes watering,
perhaps her nose red, and her cheeks blue,
and after a while, perhaps, with her hat
smashed, her habit torn, her hair hanging
down her back, and some fellow fagging by
her side drearily when he wishes her at
the devil; or think of her learning to talk
of curbs and spavins, hocks, stifle, and
thoroughpin, like the gentleman jockey of
a dragoon corps.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, you dear old thing!' exclaimed
Alison, caressing him and laughing, though
she knew that his irritation was caused only
by her having permitted Bevil Goring to
take the place of her elderly and titled
admirer.  'I have so little amusement here
at Chilcote, papa, that I did not think you
would grudge me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'A run with the hounds on Cadbury's
horses?' he interrupted, with a slight quiver,
'but I dislike the risks you run, and the
chance medley acquaintances you may meet;
but pardon my petulance, darling; and now
to dress for dinner, such as it is.'
</p>

<p>
Too well did Alison know that one of the
acquaintances referred to was her late
handsome escort; but she only said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I do love horses, and you remember,
papa, how grieved you were when I had to
relinquish, as a little girl, my dear old
Shetland pony, Pepper, and you called me
your "poor bankrupt child;" and I did so
miss Pepper with his barrel-shaped body,
his shaggy mane, and velvet nose that he
used to rub against my neck till I gave him
a carrot or an apple.'
</p>

<p>
'Hence, I am the more grateful to Cadbury
for so kindly putting his horses at your
disposal; but for him,' added Sir Ranald,
forgetting his recent remark, 'you could
not have been in your proper place with
the buckhounds, or shared in the pleasures
of the day.  Of course you wince when I
mention Cadbury,' said Sir Ranald, observing
a cloudy expression flit over her face.
</p>

<p>
'Well, papa, he bores me.'
</p>

<p>
'Bores you?  This is scarcely grateful
after all the pleasure he puts at your
disposal&mdash;his horses, his box at the opera, and
the bouquets, music, and so forth he so
frequently sends you.'
</p>

<p>
But Alison only shrugged her shoulders,
while her father retired to change his
costume; for either by force of old habit, or
out of respect for himself, he always
assumed evening dress (faded though it was) for
dinner; albeit that the latter might consist
of a little better than hashed mutton or
scrag of mutton <i>à la Russe</i>, in which the
housekeeper, Mrs. Rebecca Prune, excelled.
</p>

<p>
'I wish he would not talk to me so much
of Lord Cadbury,' thought Alison; 'if his
kindness is to be received in this fashion, I
shall never accept a mount from him again,
nor a piece of music either!'
</p>

<p>
In the few joyous hours she had spent&mdash;hours
which the presence of Bevil Goring
had, undoubtedly, served to brighten&mdash;Alison
Cheyne had forgotten for a space the
petty annoyances of her home life; its
shifts and shams that often made her weary
and sick at heart; her father's pride and
frequent petulance; his constant repining at
the present, and futile regret over the past;
his loss of position, or rather of luxury and
splendour, which the loss of fortune entailed.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
ELLON'S RING.
</h3>

<p>
For a man of acknowledged and
undoubtedly good family, Sir Ranald
had rather eccentric ideas of ancestry and
the value thereof.  He did not certainly,
like the Duke d'Aremberg or Sir Thomas
Urquhart of Cromartie, claim kindred with
the antediluvians, nor even carry his
genealogy back to the dim days of Gadifer, King
of Scotland, of whom it is recorded in that
most veracious record <i>Le Grand Chronique de
Bretagne</i>, that with Perceforest, King of
Brittany, he sailed in company from the
mouth of the Ganges, and was wrecked on
the coast of Armorica; after which they were
subsequently and severally raised to the
thrones of Britain and Caledonia by their
mutual friend Alexander le Gentil, in the
time of Julius Cæsar; but he could
solidly trace his descent from that Ranald
Cheyne of Essilmont, Cairnhill, Craig and
Inverugie, who was one of the barons that
signed the <i>Litera Communitatis Scotiœ</i> to
Edward I. of England, about the marriage
of their queen, the little Maid of Norway.
</p>

<p>
Thus he had among his ancestors men
who figured greatly in the troubles and wars
of the olden time, who fenced with steel
the throne of Robert I., who were ambassadors
to England and France for David II. and
the early James's, who shed their blood
at Flodden Field and Pinkie Cleugh, at Sark
and Ancrum Moor, and whose swords were
ever ready when their country was in peril;
and so, when he thought of these things, his
proud spirit was apt to chafe, and at such
times especially he was inclined to view with
some contempt his friend Cadbury as a
mushroom, being only a peer of yesterday,
the second of his race, and for whom not
even the ingenuity of the united College of
Heralds could 'fudge' out a pedigree; but,
for all that, the ample wealth of the latter
was not without its due and solid weight in
his estimation.
</p>

<p>
Like more than one old northern family,
the Cheynes of Essilmont were supposed&mdash;nay,
were confidently alleged&mdash;to have a
mysterious warning of death or approaching
woe, such as the spectre drummer whose
beat at Cortachy announces when fate is
nigh the 'bonnie House of Airlie,' like the
bell of Coull that tolls of itself when a
Dorward dies, the hairy-handed Meg Moulach
of the Grants, the headless horseman of
Maclean, or the solitary swan that floats on
a certain lake at times fatal to another race;
and so the Cheynes of Essilmont were
supposed to be haunted by a spectral black
hound, in the appearance of which Sir Ranald
strove to disbelieve in spite of himself,
though its solemn baying had been heard
when Ellon died in India and his mother in
London; and as for old Archy Auchindoir,
the family factotum, he believed in it as he
did in his own existence.
</p>

<p>
'Original sin,' <i>i.e.</i>, the accumulated debts
of a generation or two past, with his own
mad extravagance in youth, had so
completely impaired Sir Ranald's exchequer that,
on a few hundreds per annum, the wreck of
all his fortune, he was compelled, though
not content, to live, 'vegetate' he deemed
it, quietly in an old house in Hampshire;
and times there were when in the great
weariness of his heart&mdash;especially after the
death of his two sons&mdash;he often thought,
could he but see Alison provided for as he
wished, he had no other desire than to be
laid where many of his ancestors lay, a right
which none could deny him, in the ancient
chapel of Essilmont, where often he had
with envy regarded the stiff and prostrate
mailed effigies on their altar tombs, lying
there with sword and shield, their faces
expressive of stern serenity, and their hands
folded in eternal prayer.
</p>

<p>
Chilcote, his present abode, was buried
deep in woods that must have been a portion
of the New Forest or the relics thereof,
and had been built somewhere about the
time of Queen Anne.  Thus a great amount
of solid oak formed a portion of its structure;
and in the principal rooms the mantel-pieces
ascended in carved work nearly to the
ceilings, while the jambs were of massive
stone, with caryatides, like the god Terminus,
wreathed to the waist in leaves, supporting
the entablatures.
</p>

<p>
The walls were divided into compartments
by moulded panelling, painted with
imaginary landscapes and ruins; the armorial
bearings of the Chilcotes of other days;
and beneath the surbase (or chairbelt, as it
used to be called) were smaller panels, all
painted with fruit and flowers.
</p>

<p>
The windows were deeply embayed, with
cushioned seats.  One of these was, in the
summer evenings, the favourite niche in
which Alison was wont to perch herself
with one of Mudie's latest novels.
</p>

<p>
The furniture was all old, faded, 'shabby,'
Alison truly deemed it; but in tone it
seemed much in unison with the rooms, on the
walls of which her father had hung a few
family pictures, the pride of his heart,
gentlemen in ruffs and cloaks, dames in
stomachers and capuchins, and two there were in
whom he loved to trace a fancied resemblance
to his dead sons, Ranald and Ellon,
for they were brothers, and bore the same
names&mdash;Ranald Cheyne, who fell at the head
of the Scots Life Guards at Worcester, and
Ellon Cheyne, who had died previously at
the storming of Newcastle; both men
portrayed in the gorgeous costume of their
time, and both looked to the life,
'blue-blooded Scottish cavaliers, pale,
smooth-skinned, with moustache and love lock,
haughty and imperious,' and each with an
expression of face that seemed to say they
would have thought as little of spitting a
crop-eared roundhead as a lark, with their
long Toledoes.
</p>

<p>
On the day after the hunt Lord Cadbury's
groom, Gaskins, came riding to Chilcote with
a magnificent bouquet from the conservatories
for Alison, and his master's anxious
inquiries as to how she had enjoyed the sport
of the previous day, and a hope that she
had not suffered from fatigue; and Alison, as
she buried her pretty pink nostrils among
the cool and fragrant roses, smiled covertly
and mischievously as she heard from Gaskins
how his master had 'got such a precious
spill by funking at a bull-finch, when the
hounds were thrown off, that he would be
confined to the house for some days.'
</p>

<p>
Thus for a time she would be free from
the annoyance of his presence.
</p>

<p>
Archie, the white-haired man-of-all-work,
gave Mr. Gaskins a tankard of beer after he
had leaped into his saddle, where he took
what Archie called a 'standing drink, like
the coo o' Forfar.'  Lord Cadbury's powdered
servants, in elaborate liveries, were
always a source of supreme contempt (mingled,
perhaps, with envy) to Sir Ranald's
staunch henchman, and now he felt inclined
to sneer if he could at the well-appointed
groom, in his dark grey surtout, waistbelt,
cockade, and top-boots.
</p>

<p>
'Braw leathers, thae o' yours,' said he,
regarding the latter with some interest.
</p>

<p>
'Yaas,' drawled Gaskins.  'I flatter myself
that few gents appear with better boot
tops than Cadbury and myself.  I clean
them with a preparation&mdash;quite a conserve,
Mr. Hackendore, peculiarly my own.'
</p>

<p>
'And what may that be?' asked Archie.
</p>

<p>
'Champagne and apricot jam,' replied
Gaskins, twirling his moustache and eyeing
the old man with intense superciliousness.
</p>

<p>
'Set ye up, indeed, wi' your buits and
belts!' snapped Archie.  'Ye think yoursel'
made for the siller; but a bawbee cat may
look at a king.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't understand the sense of your
remark,' drawled Gaskins, shortening his
reins.
</p>

<p>
'Like enough&mdash;like enough; mony complain
o' want o' siller, but few complain o'
want o' sense; and a gowk at Yule will ne'er
be bricht at Beltane.'
</p>

<p>
'What the devil is he talking about?'
thought the bewildered groom, as he put
spurs to his horse and trotted away.
</p>

<p>
'Wi' a' his bravery,' said Archie, with a
grimace, 'he's a loon that will loup the dyke
where it's laighest.'
</p>

<p>
Alison divided the bouquet into portions
for various vases to ornament her drawing-room,
and on the following day, after a
more than usually careful toilette, while her
father was occupied in worry and perplexity
over letters and accounts, seated herself in
the deep bay of a window that overlooked
the avenue, her heart beating quicker as the
noon wore on.
</p>

<p>
She had a novel in her hand, but we
doubt if she knew even the title of it.
Pleasure, doubt, and anxiety were mingling
in the girl's mind&mdash;pleasure, as she thought,
'I shall see him again for a time, however
brief!'&mdash;doubt of what might ensue if she
saw him under the keen watchful eyes of her
father, who could detect every expression of
her face, and a great anxiety lest she might
be requested to avoid all intimacy, even
acquaintanceship, with Bevil Goring in
future; but little could she foresee the turn
matters were to take, or the events of the
next few days.
</p>

<p>
Luncheon was long past, and the afternoon
was drawing on, when Goring rode
down the avenue and gave the bridle of his
horse to Archie Auchindoir, who, with a
considerable appearance of being flustered,
had&mdash;on the approach of a visitor&mdash;hurried
from the garden, where he had been at
work, to don an old black claw-hammer coat,
the reversion of Sir Ranald's wardrobe.
</p>

<p>
He ran the bridle rein deftly through an
iron ring in the ivy-covered porch, and
preceded the young officer, whose card he
placed on a silver tray with as much
formality as if the little mansion of
Chilcote had been a residence like Buckingham
Palace.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald bade him welcome with finished
courtesy and old-fashioned grace, while
Alison, her cheek mantling with ill-concealed
pleasure&mdash;for what young girl but
feels her pulses quicken in the presence of a
handsome and welcome admirer&mdash;continued
to keep her back to the windows; thus,
during the usual exchange of commonplaces and
inquiries, Sir Ranald, who watched both,
failed to detect anything in the manner of
either that could lead to the inference that
they had more interest in each other than
ordinary acquaintances, and began to feel
rather grateful to the young officer who had
come to do them a kindness.
</p>

<p>
'So glad to see you again, Captain Goring,
and to thank you for your care of Miss
Cheyne when with the hounds,' he said,
motioning their visitor to a seat.  'The
cavalier to whom I entrusted her, Lord
Cadbury, seems to have come to grief at his
first fence,' added the old gentleman,
laughing over the mishap of his friend, to whom
Goring would rather that no reference had
been made.
</p>

<p>
'I promised to call, Sir Ranald, and
inquire for Miss Cheyne, after our pretty
rough run, especially by Burnham Beeches,
where the pack hunted their game pretty
hard,' said Goring, 'and also to beg her
acceptance of a relic of your son Ellon, of the
Hussars, of which I became possessed by the
merest chance in India.'
</p>

<p>
'A thousand thanks.  Most kind of you,
Captain Goring,' said Sir Ranald, his usually
pale cheek reddening for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'I learned incidentally from Miss Cheyne,
as we rode towards Chilcote, that the poor
lad who was killed at Lahore was her
younger brother, and that the ring I possess
had been his.  It is here,' he added,
opening a tiny morocco box, in which he had
placed the ring.
</p>

<p>
It was a richly chased trinket, having
two clam-shells of gold, with a diamond in
the centre of each.
</p>

<p>
'Ellon's ring it is, indeed,' exclaimed Sir
Ranald, in a changed voice, while the moisture
clouded the glasses of his <i>pince-nez</i>.
</p>

<p>
'My farewell gift to him on the morning
he marched from Maidstone&mdash;you remember,
papa,' exclaimed Alison, with tears in
her voice.
</p>

<p>
'I am not likely to forget, God help me,
that both my boys are gone, and now I
have&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Only me, papa.'
</p>

<p>
'It is a source of supreme satisfaction that
I am the means of restoring this to his
family,' Goring added, judiciously, as he was on
the point of saying 'sister,' and he placed it
in her hand; but that hand seemed so slim
and white and beautiful that he was tempted
to do more, for he slipped the ring rather
playfully and rather nervously on one of her
fingers, saying, 'It is a world too wide.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' said Sir Ranald, 'it is a man's
ring.
</p>

<p>
'But, see!' exclaimed Alison, as she
pressed a spring, of the existence of which
Goring had been until that moment ignorant,
and the two clamshells unclosing
showed a minutely and beautifully coloured
little photo, no larger than a shilling, of her
own charming face.
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens!' said Goring, with genuine
surprise and pleasure, 'I was all unaware of
this secret, though I have worn the ring for
two years and more.'
</p>

<p>
'And all that time you have been wearing
<i>my</i> ring, <i>my</i> hair, <i>my</i> likeness,' muttered
Alison, in a low voice, while Sir Ranald was
ringing the bell.
</p>

<p>
'Delicious fatality,' thought Goring, as he
looked on the sweet flushed face that was
upturned to his, and their eyes met in a
mutual glance that expressed more than
their lips dared tell already, and which
neither ever forgot.  Luckily at that moment
the baronet, on hospitable thoughts intent,
was ordering Archie to bring wine, mentioning
a rare brand from the small store which
yet remained of the wreck of better days&mdash;a
store kept for visitors alone.
</p>

<p>
'My brothers died within a month of each
other in India, Captain Goring,' said Alison.
'Poor mamma never got over the double
shock, and&mdash;and&mdash;we have never been at
Essilmont since.'
</p>

<p>
'Could not your presence, your existence,
console her?' asked Goring.
</p>

<p>
'No; her soul was centred in her boys.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall never forget your kindness, Captain
Goring, in bringing us this little relic of
Ellon,' said Sir Ranald; 'and now after
your ride from the camp try a glass of this
white <i>Clos Vougeot</i>.  But perhaps you would
prefer red.  We have both, I think,
Archie?'
</p>

<p>
Though the last bottle of the red sparkling
Burgundy had long since vanished, Archie
vowed there was a binful, and fortunately
for his veracity Goring announced a
decided preference for the white; and while
Alison played dreamily with her brother's
ring, and thought again and again how
strange it was that her hair and her likeness
should have been worn with it for so long
in far and distant lands by Bevil Goring, the
conversation turned to general subjects
between the latter and her father, who came
secretly to the conclusion that he 'was a
very fine young fellow.'
</p>

<p>
He had seen the last on earth of Ellon,
had stood by his grave, had seen the smoke
of the death volleys curling over it, and seen
it covered up; thus Alison thought he was
more to her than any mere stranger could
ever be, and already, in her heart, she had
begun to deem him more indeed.
</p>

<p>
And after he had taken his departure,
when she offered the ring to Sir Ranald, to
her joy, he begged her to retain it, and,
much to her surprise, answered that he
meant to have a little dinner party.
</p>

<p>
'You quite take my heart away, papa&mdash;a
dinner party!' exclaimed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, we shall have this young fellow
Goring (he asked me to dine at his mess,
you know), and his brother officers Dalton
and Wilmot, Cadbury of course, and you
can have Mrs. Trelawney, who is always
charming company, to keep you in
countenance&mdash;a nice little party.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa,' exclaimed Alison, in genuine
dismay, 'think of our poor <i>ménage</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Tut&mdash;consult Mrs. Prune on the subject.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought you wished to have a rest from
dinner parties.'
</p>

<p>
'I have been at so many, that some return&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but&mdash;but, papa&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What next, child?'
</p>

<p>
'Our last quarter's bills were so large,'
urged Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Large for our exchequer, I have no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us call it luncheon, papa, and I
think I shall arrange it nicely,' she pleaded,
her heart quickening at the chance of
meeting Bevil (she already thought of him as
'Bevil') again.  So that was decided on,
and the invitation notes were quickly despatched.
</p>

<p>
Alison had watched from a window the
shadow of their visitor, as that of man and
horse lengthened out on the sunlighted
road, until shadow and form passed away;
but Goring, as he rode homeward, was little
aware that he had not seen the <i>last</i> of Ellon
Cheyne's ring.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
LAURA TRELAWNEY.
</h3>

<p>
The invited guests all responded, and
accepted almost by return of post, and
a sigh of relief escaped Sir Ranald when he
found no missives came with them, as he
was generally well pleased when he saw the
village postman pass the avenue gate.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Goring, I see, uses sealing
wax&mdash;good custom&mdash;good old style,' said he,
returning that officer's note to Alison, who
prized it rather more than he knew; 'uses
a shield too&mdash;the chevron and annulets of
the Gorings of Sussex&mdash;not a crest; every
trumpery fellow sticks one on his notepaper
now&mdash;the crest that never shone on a
helmet.'
</p>

<p>
So, from this circumstance, Bevil Goring
rose in the estimation of the baronet, who
knew all Burke's Armory by rote.
</p>

<p>
The luncheon lay heavy on poor Alison's
heart; she thought of their <i>cuisine</i>, as it too
often was&mdash;refined and dainty though her
father's tastes were&mdash;meat roasted dubiously,
then made up into stews and lumpy minces,
with rice puddings, and she shivered with
dismay, and had long and deep consultations
with old Mrs. Rebecca Prune and her
daughter Daisy; but when the day came
her fears were ended, and she began 'to see
her way,' as she said, and contemplated the
table with some complacency.
</p>

<p>
In her blue morning robe, trimmed with
white, which suited so well her complexion
and the character of her beauty, she was
cutting and placing in crystal vases the
monthly roses and few meagre flowers with
fern leaves from her tiny conservatory at the
sunny end of the house to decorate the table.
</p>

<p>
'Don't they look pretty, papa?' she
exclaimed, almost gleefully.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, but you, pet Alison, are the
sweetest flower of them all,' said Sir Ranald,
kissing the close white division of her rich
brown hair.
</p>

<p>
'"Dawted dochters mak' daidling wives,"
they say,' muttered old Archie, who was
busy polishing a salver; 'but our dear doo,
Miss Alison, will never be ane o' them, Sir
Ranald.'
</p>

<p>
For the honour of the house, Archie had
been most anxious to furnish his quota to
the feast, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Miss Alison, I am sure I would catch ye
some troots in the burn owre by, though the
weeds ha'e grown sae in the water, if you
would like them.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Archie, you old dear,' replied
Alison, laughing, 'but we won't require
them.'
</p>

<p>
The cold salmon and fowls, the salads,
some game, the grapes, and other etceteras
of a well-appointed repast, to which delicate
cutlets were to be added, with some of Sir
Ranald's irreproachable wines&mdash;almost the
last remnants of a once well-stocked cellar&mdash;made
the table complete, and Alison content;
nor must we forget the dainty china
and crested silver dishes, heirlooms for
generations back, which were brought from
their repositories, and were the pride of old
Auchindoir's heart and of his master's too.
</p>

<p>
The chief of these was a relic of considerable
antiquity, being nothing less than a
maizer, or goblet of silver, bequeathed by
Elizabeth, Queen Consort of Scotland, to
her master of the household, the Laird of
Essilmont, who, with Douglas, pursued
Edward of England from Bannockburn to
the gates of Dunbar, and which had
emblazoned (in faded colours) and graven on
it the Cheyne arms, chequy or and azure, a
fess gules, fretty of the first, and crested
with a buck's head, erased.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney and her little daughter
were the first to arrive.  She swept up to
Alison, kissed her on both cheeks, with more
genuine affection than effusiveness, and
apologised for the presence of her little
companion.
</p>

<p>
'I knew you would pardon me bringing
the poor child.  She has no one to love
but me, and mopes so much when left alone.'
</p>

<p>
'Netty, I hope, loves me too,' exclaimed
Alison, taking the girl&mdash;a bright little thing
of some eight years or so, with a shower of
clustering curls&mdash;in her arms and kissing her
fondly.  'I don't think papa would consider
his little entertainment complete without
Netty to prattle to him.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney, a brilliant blonde of
seven and twenty, though a widow, looked
almost girlish for her years; her figure was
tall and eminently handsome; her white-lidded
and long-lashed hazel eyes were full
of brilliant expression; her manner was
vivacious, and every action of her hands and
head graceful in the extreme.  She formed
an attractive and leading feature in every
circle, and usually was the centre of a group
of gentlemen everywhere, and yet, singular
to say, she rather avoided than courted both
notice and society.
</p>

<p>
When she talked she seemed the art of
pleasing personified; her words, her gestures,
her bright eyes, and beautiful lips were
all prepossessing.
</p>

<p>
She would invest petty trifles with interest;
her accents were those of grace, and
she could polish the point of an epigram,
or say even a bold thing, better certainly
than any other woman Alison had ever met.
Her vivacity was said to approach folly; but
even in her moments of folly, she was always interesting.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand she had times of
depression almost amounting to gloom, most
singular even to those who knew her best,
and it was averred that, though not very
rich, she had refused many eligible offers, and
preferred the perfect freedom of widowhood.
</p>

<p>
'And now, dear,' she said, as she took an
accustomed seat in the drawing-room, 'tell
me all who are coming.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, there is Lord Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course.'
</p>

<p>
'And Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' said the pretty widow, fanning
herself, though a crystal screen was
between her and the fire.
</p>

<p>
'Why of course?' asked Alison, colouring;
'and there is Jerry Wilmot&mdash;your
devoted&mdash;and Captain Dalton, who will be
sure to fall in love with you.'
</p>

<p>
At Dalton's name Mrs. Trelawney changed
colour; indeed she grew so perceptibly
pale, while her lips quivered, that Alison
remarked it.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest, what agitates you so?  Do you
know him?' asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;not at all!'
</p>

<p>
'What then&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I knew one of the same name who did
me&mdash;let me rather say&mdash;my family&mdash;a great wrong.'
</p>

<p>
'But he cannot be the same person.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no.  Besides, this Captain Dalton
has just come from India with his regiment.
And so you think he will be sure to fall in
love with me?' added Mrs. Trelawney, recovering
her colour and her smiles; 'and I
with him perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'That does not follow; but he seems just
the kind of man I think a widow might fall
in love with&mdash;handsome and manly, grave,
earnest, and sympathetic.'
</p>

<p>
'But he may share in the aversion of
Mr. Weller, senior, and have his tendency
to beware of widows.  I feel certain,
Alison dear, that your Captain Dalton will
never suit me.'
</p>

<p>
'You have seen him, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;with the buckhounds the other day.'
</p>

<p>
'Wilmot, who admires you so much, will
one day be very rich, they say.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't talk thus, Alison, or I shall begin
to deem you what I know you are
not&mdash;mercenary; but Jerry Wilmot has little
just now; he has, however, a knowledge of
horseflesh and a great capability for
spending money, and thinks a pack of hounds in
a hunting country is necessary to existence.
He is a detrimental of the first water, and
the special <i>bête-noire</i> of Belgravian and
Tyburnian mammas.'
</p>

<p>
'It is a pity you should ever seclude
yourself as you sometimes do, Laura,' said
Alison, looking at her beautiful friend with
genuine admiration; 'all men admire you
so much, and you have but to hold up your
little finger to make them kneel at your feet.'
</p>

<p>
'How you flatter me!  But I never will
hold up my little finger, nor would I marry
again for the mines of Potosi and Peru.  It
is as well that little Netty is so busy with
that photographic album, or she might
marvel at your anxiety to provide her with
a papa.'
</p>

<p>
'It is not wealth you wait for?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What then, Laura?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'How I shall laugh if the handsome
Captain Dalton stirs that now unimpressionable
heart of yours.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall be very glad to meet him,' said
Mrs. Trelawney, with a curious hardness in
her voice.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I may compel him to love me,
Alison,' and as Mrs. Trelawney spoke her
eyes flashed with a triumphant glow such as
Alison had never seen in them before.
</p>

<p>
'Compel him?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'It would be easy to make him love you;
but would you marry him?'
</p>

<p>
'How your little head runs on love and
marriage!  No, Alison, I shall never marry&mdash;<i>again</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Poor soul,' thought Alison, admiringly,
'how much she must have loved her first husband!'
</p>

<p>
And simultaneously with the entrance of
Sir Ranald, the three brother officers&mdash;Bevil
Goring, Jerry Wilmot, and Captain Dalton&mdash;were
announced, and all these were men
of the best style, in accurate morning
costume, all more than usually good-looking,
set up by drill, easy in bearing, and looking
ruddy with their ride from the camp in a
chill October day.
</p>

<p>
'I missed you early in the hunt, Miss
Cheyne,' said Jerry, after the introductions
were over.  'How you and Goring flew
over that first fence!'
</p>

<p>
'I love to gallop over everything,' replied
Alison, 'but I must confess that my sympathies
in the field are always with the flying
stag, or the poor little panting hare&mdash;a
miserable, tiny creature, with a horde of
men, horses, and dogs after it, and making
the welkin ring when in at the death!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, though by the way I never know
precisely what the said welkin is, unless it
be the regions of the air.'
</p>

<p>
All unaware that his name had been so
recently and so curiously on her lovely lips,
Captain, or Tony Dalton, as his comrades
called him, was saying some commonplaces
to Mrs. Trelawney, over whose chair he
was stooping.
</p>

<p>
He was not much her senior perhaps in
years, but he had seen much of service in
India.  Tall and dark, with closely-shorn
brown hair, he had an air and face that
were commanding; but with a simple grace
of bearing that belied any appearance of
self-assertion.
</p>

<p>
After India, where he had been long on
a station up country; where all the
Europeans were males, and not a lady within
three hundred miles; where a wet towel
and half a water-melon formed the morning
head-dress, and visits of the water-carrier
incessant; where books were scarce, serials
scarcer, flies and heat plentiful; and where
the little tawny women, with their nose-rings
and orange-coloured cheeks, were all
alike hideous, to see such a woman as
Mrs. Trelawny, with her snowy skin, her
shell-like ears, and marvellous hands, was
something indeed.
</p>

<p>
She was dressed in rich dark silk&mdash;not
mourning; she wore no widow's cap, but
had her fine hair simply braided in a heavy
and beautiful coil at the back of her
handsome head, and she looked as fair and
lovely as she must have done on her
marriage morning.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring had begun to address
Alison, whose sweet eyes were shyly
upturned to his as she placed in the bosom of
her dress a rosebud he had taken from the
lapel of his coat, when the deep Doric
voice of Archie Auchindoir was heard
announcing the <i>bête-noire</i> of both.
</p>

<p>
'Lord Cawdbury.'
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
ALISON'S LUNCHEON PARTY.
</h3>

<p>
A man, between fifty and sixty years of
age, having a short, paunchy, and
ungainly figure, grizzled hair, ferret-like
eyes with a cunning unscrupulous expression,
and a long heavy moustache which was
almost white, entered with a smiling face
and an easy and well-assured air that was
born, not of innate good breeding, but of
the supreme confidence given by position
and a well-stocked purse.
</p>

<p>
Coarse and large hands and ears, with an
over-display of jewellery, especially two or
three gold-digger-like rings, showed that,
though the second peer of his family, Lord
Cadbury was of very humble origin indeed.
</p>

<p>
His face wore its brightest smile as he
greeted his hostess, Alison, and under his
white moustache showed the remainder of
a set of teeth that, as Jerry Wilmot said
afterwards, were like the remnants of the
old Guard, 'few in number and very much
the worse for wear.'
</p>

<p>
He shook the slender hand of Sir Ranald
with considerable cordiality, yet not without
an air of patronage, bowed over Mrs. Trelawney's
gloved fingers, nodded slightly to
the three officers (Cadbury did not like
military men), and, seating himself by Alison's
side, banteringly accused her of running
away at Salthill and leaving him behind (he
did not say in the ditch), which was
precisely what she did do; nor did she attempt
to excuse herself, but simply rose and took
his arm when Archie announced the luncheon
was ready, and, the moment he seated
himself, the peer began to expatiate
upon the improvements he was making at
Cadbury Court, for behoof of the table
generally, though his remarks were made
especially to her; but she heard with
indifference a description of the vineries,
pineries, and so forth, which he was erecting
at a vast cost.
</p>

<p>
Not so her father, who, with the <i>pince-nez</i>
balanced on his aristocratic nose, heard
of these things with a face which wore a
curiously mingled expression of satisfaction
and contempt; for he failed not to
recognize a tone of vulgar ostentation that
seemed so well to suit, he thought, 'the
tradesman's coronet of yesterday,' and
endeavoured to turn the conversation to
hunting, though his days for it were passed.
</p>

<p>
'The world changes, and has changed in
many things, Captain Dalton,' said he; 'but
true to his old instincts man will always be
a huntsman and a soldier.'
</p>

<p>
'But to uncart a tame deer, or let a hare
out of a bag, and then pursue it with horse
and dog as if one's life depended upon the
recapture, scarcely seems a sane proceeding,'
said Lord Cadbury, who still felt the effects
of his 'spill' in the field, 'and all unsuited
to this age of refinement.'
</p>

<p>
'I believe only in the refinement that is
produced by the education of generations,'
said Sir Ranald, a little irrelevantly, as he
tugged his white moustache and felt himself
unable to repress a covert sneer at the very
man for whom he had destined Alison, with
whom the peer was too much occupied to
hear what was said.
</p>

<p>
With all her regard and esteem for old
Archie Auchindoir, Alison was rather bored
by the bewilderment of Goring and others,
on whom he was in attendance, at his
quaintness, oddity, and unintelligible
dialect; and sooth to say, all undeterred by
rank and wealth, he was very inattentive
and curt to Lord Cadbury, of whose views
he was no more ignorant than most servants
usually are of their superior's affairs.
</p>

<p>
Thus many a grimace stole over his
wrinkled and saturnine visage as he watched the
pair, and muttered, as he carved game at
the sideboard&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'It is a braw thing to be lo'ed, nae doubt,
but wha wad mool wi' an auld moudiewart
like that?  No our Miss Alison, certes.'
</p>

<p>
On the strength of his wealth and rank, of
many a pretty present forced upon her
unwillingly, yet with her father's consent, and
curiously enough upon his great seniority to
her in years, which enabled him 'to do the
paternal,' as Mrs. Trelawney once said, Lord
Cadbury assumed a kind of right of proprietary
in Alison Cheyne that was very galling
to the latter before her guests, and under
the sense of which Bevil Goring chafed in
secret as he drank his wine in silence and
gnawed his moustache in sheer anger, for
Alison was fast becoming to him more
than he might ever dare acknowledge to
herself.
</p>

<p>
'You must have married when very
young, Mrs. Trelawney,' said Dalton, who
was plying her daughter with grapes and
crystallised fruits.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;I was just seventeen.'
</p>

<p>
'It is so romantic to marry young.'
</p>

<p>
'Too romantic perhaps to be either a
sensible or a practical proceeding,' said
Mrs. Trelawney, her slender fingers contrasting
in their whiteness with the deep crimson of
her claret glass; 'but there is only one
thing else better than marrying young.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To die young, Captain Dalton!' she said,
laughingly, yet with a curious flash in her
soft hazel eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Like those whom the gods love?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
Dalton knew not what to make of these
strange speeches, but after a time he began
to see that she was rather given to indulging
in wild and even bitter ones, yet all said
laughingly; and he rapidly began to regard
her as a species of beautiful enigma.
</p>

<p>
To Alison it became apparent that a
sudden change had come over her friend Laura
at the first sight of Captain Dalton; she had
grown pale and silent, and even <i>distrait</i>&mdash;so
much so that Alison had whispered to
her,
</p>

<p>
'Does he remind you of anyone?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she had replied.
</p>

<p>
'Of whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me.'
</p>

<p>
'She is thinking of her dead husband, no
doubt.  Dear me, if this should prove a
case!' thought the little match-maker, who
saw that as the luncheon proceeded
Mrs. Trelawney was all gaiety, smiles, and
brilliance, and too evidently leaving nothing
undone by sallies of wit to fascinate Dalton;
and Alison felt grateful to her that by her
gaiety she had made the little luncheon
quite a success, as she felt it to have been
when all returned to the drawing-room to
have some music.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Laura dear,' said she, 'we all look
to you first,' and Dalton led the widow to
the piano, and she began to play readily
with great brilliancy, force, and execution
some very rare and difficult pieces of music,
while he stood by and turned over the
leaves; and when pressed to sing she began
at once a little ballad the words of which
were curious, and went to a singularly slow,
sad, and wailing air:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Think not of me in summer's blush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When flowers around thee spring,<br>
  And warbling birds on every bush<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sweetest music sing.<br>
  Think not of me, when winter stern,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His icy throne uprears,<br>
  And long lost friends with joy return,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell of other years.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'But when the sighing breezes own<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad autumn's blighting sway,<br>
  And withered flowers and leaves are strewn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence o'er thy way;<br>
  Then think of me! for withered lies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dearest hope I nursed;<br>
  And I have seen, with bitter sighs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brightest dream dispersed.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Other verses&mdash;of which these are a
sample&mdash;followed, and her voice, tender, plaintive,
half passionate, and somewhat piteous, gave
a powerful effect to the words, to which
Tony Dalton seemed to listen like a man in
a dream as he hung over her.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Laura,' exclaimed Alison, hurrying
to her side, with a merry little laugh, 'that
melodramatic ditty is most unlike you.
Where, in the name of goodness, did you
pick it up?'
</p>

<p>
'I have heard that song long, long ago,
Mrs. Trelawney,' said Captain Dalton, trying
to pull himself together.
</p>

<p>
'When?' asked the singer, turning her
eyes upon him with one of their most
effective glances under lashes long and
dark.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say,' replied the officer; 'but I
have heard these verses sung by a voice so
like yours that I am bewildered.'
</p>

<p>
'Was it in a dream?' she asked, softly.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'I found them in an old album, in which
they were written by a friend years ago.'
</p>

<p>
'What friend?' asked Dalton, almost
mechanically.
</p>

<p>
'That matters little now, nor could it
interest you.'
</p>

<p>
'It does&mdash;it does, because I knew that
song well years ago, as you say.'
</p>

<p>
Her eyelashes quivered, even her hands
trembled with some real or perhaps
pretended emotion, and she cut short the
subject by dashing at once into a piece of
Verdi's music, and by her brilliancy and
sparkle she seemed to be absorbing Dalton
entirely now, greatly to the dismay of Jerry,
who was one of her bondsmen.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney, who had undoubtedly
been studying the former, saw that he was
in many ways an interesting man, whose
face and bearing indicated that he had seen
much of the world, much of human life, and
done all that a soldier might do in it&mdash;that
there was at times something of restlessness
and impatience in his eyes and on
his lips, as of a man who had a secret, the
clue to which she was curious to find.
</p>

<p>
When Alison took her place at the piano,
where Goring posted himself on duty to turn
the leaves (old Lord Cadbury knew not a
note of music luckily), Mrs. Trelawney drew
her daughter towards her, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'This is my little girl, Captain Dalton.
Give your hand, child.'
</p>

<p>
The latter, a very little girl, indeed&mdash;quite
a small lady&mdash;gave her tiny hand to
Dalton, who looked into her shy eyes
earnestly, and then said, with a bright
smile&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'How singular that she is not like you!'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;she is dark-complexioned,'
</p>

<p>
'And you are almost blonde, though your
eyes are hazel.  I presume she resembles
her father?'
</p>

<p>
'She does in many points&mdash;in others I
hope she never will,' added Mrs. Trelawney,
in her heart.
</p>

<p>
'Is it long since she lost him?' asked
Dalton, softly.
</p>

<p>
'She never knew him.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Fate took him from me before she was born.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor child!' said Dalton, caressing the
girl's soft and silky hair, while her tiny
fingers toyed with a ring he wore; 'she is
quite a little beauty, but she could not fail
to be so.'
</p>

<p>
'You are pleased to be complimentary,
Captain Dalton,' said Mrs. Trelawney, who
seemed more pleased with his admiration of
the child than of herself, and a little sigh
escaped her.
</p>

<p>
There was now, as when she sang, a
great tenderness in her voice, a kind of
plaintive ring in it that stirred Dalton's
heart curiously, and when she asked him
question upon question, with a considerable
depth of interest, as to the places he had
seen, the adventures that had befallen him,
the battles in which he had shared, and so
forth, he found himself gradually unfolding
to her all his past interests, his present
plans, his future hopes&mdash;if, indeed, he had
any; while she listened with her inquiring
eyes, half veiled by their drooping lids,
fixed on his, her bosom heaving, and a
white hand swaying her feather fan
mechanically to and fro.
</p>

<p>
'And now tell me, Captain Dalton,' said
she suddenly, as he paused; 'but you will
think me very curious&mdash;in all these years of
military wandering, how you never thought
of marriage?'
</p>

<p>
'A strange question!' said he.
</p>

<p>
'And a leading one, you may think,' she
resumed, laughing merrily; 'but we widows
are privileged people&mdash;well?'
</p>

<p>
'Never!' said he, in a low, husky voice,
and, through the bronze the Indian sun had
cast upon his cheek, she could see the scarlet
blush that mantled there, and, rather
shrinking from the turn their conversation had
taken, he drew back, and his place was
instantly assumed by Jerry Wilmot, who
plunged at once into a conversation, which
he conducted in a low and confidential tone,
while playing with her fan, of which he had
possessed himself.
</p>

<p>
Jerry Wilmot was eminently a handsome
fellow.  From his well set-up soldierly head
to his slender well-moulded feet no fault
could be found with him; but though his
manner and conversation were full of that
subtle flattery and earnestness which, if it
does not make its way to a woman's heart,
at least appeals to her vanity, he made no
progress apparently with Mrs. Trelawney,
who on this occasion listened to him with less
patience than usual, and without even her
generally amused smile.
</p>

<p>
'Are all men precisely alike to you?'
whispered Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'In the main they are.'
</p>

<p>
'This evening too?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;decidedly so,' she replied, with a
side glance.  'Now please give me my fan,
Jerry, and don't break it, as you so often do.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
'THE OLD, OLD STORY.'
</h3>

<p>
On this afternoon Alison felt, with
pleasant confidence, that she was 'looking
her best,' dressed to perfection, and had
been equal to the occasion.  She wore a
closely-fitting costume of lustreless black
silk, edged everywhere with rare old white
lace that had been her mother's; her hair
appeared more golden than brown in the
sunshine, while seeming to retain the latter
in its silky coils.
</p>

<p>
Round her slender neck was a collarette
of soft, filmy white lace, and in it was a
Provence rose, which Lord Cadbury had
not been slow to detect as one from his own
bouquet, and gathered some hope therefrom,
as Bevil Goring did from her wearing
his rosebud.
</p>

<p>
As she stood in the deep bay of one of
the old windows, with the full flood of the
ruddy afternoon sun streaming upon her,
she made a charming picture, and there
Goring joined her, while the rest were all
engaged in general conversation.  He was
already feeling that to be near her was happiness,
and that to see her, even across a table,
was a thousand degrees better than not
seeing her at all.
</p>

<p>
And she&mdash;brief though their acquaintance
was&mdash;had become conscious of a quicker
beating of her pulse, an undefinable sense
of pleasure pervading her whole form, a
mantling of colour in her cheek when he
approached or spoke to her.  Little had as
yet passed between them; but the tell-tale
eyes had told much.
</p>

<p>
'What a wonderful vista of old beech-trees!'
said Goring, referring to the view
from the windows.
</p>

<p>
'And the distant village spire closes it so
prettily,' she replied; 'but you cannot see
it properly from this point&mdash;but from that little terrace.'
</p>

<p>
'May we step out?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes.'
</p>

<p>
She tried to open the window, a French
one, which opened to the floor within and
to a couple of stone steps without.
</p>

<p>
'Allow me,' murmured Goring, and as he
drew back the latch his fingers closed for a
moment over hers.
</p>

<p>
They were only friends&mdash;he was only a
visitor&mdash;why should she not show him the
view, or anything else that interested him?
She took a Shetland shawl from a chair
close by, threw it over her head, and,
gathering the soft folds under her pretty
chin in a hand that was white as a rosebud,
passed out with him upon the little terrace
hat overlooked her garden.
</p>

<p>
'And so that is Chilcote Church?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Captain Goring&mdash;an old edifice&mdash;old,
they say, as the time of Edward the
Elder.  It is covered with ivy, and is a
capital subject to sketch.'
</p>

<p>
'And is this building here, with the
eaves, your stable?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no&mdash;we have no stables; but it is
the scene of my peculiar care,' replied
Alison, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'My hen-house.'
</p>

<p>
And, with all his growing admiration of
her, the fashionable young officer almost
laughed when his charming companion
showed him her hen-houses&mdash;her beautiful
Hamburgs, Dorkings, and their chutches of
Cochin-China chickens.
</p>

<p>
'Do you like bees?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;they sting, you know; but I don't
object to the honey.'
</p>

<p>
So she showed him her hives, as if Goring
had never seen such things before; and so
on by the duck-pond, and round the
old-fashioned house, with its heavy eaves,
dormer windows, and masses of ivy, and he could
only think what a picturesque background
it made to the central figure of his lovely
companion, who, sooth to say, in the
pleasure of his society, forgot all about her
other guests; or, if she did think, she knew
that Mrs. Trelawney could amuse them all.
</p>

<p>
To Bevil Goring Alison was quite
unlike any other girl he had met, she seemed
so highly bred, and yet withal so natural.
There seemed to be an originality about her
that piqued his fancy, while her freshness of
heart was charming; and she often showed
a depth of thought and consideration&mdash;born
perhaps of her family troubles and
surroundings&mdash;that surprised and interested him.
More than all did her grace and beauty
bewilder him; and after this, amid the
routine of duty at Aldershot, and during
many a dusty day of drill in the Long
Valley, he could only think of her image,
her soft laughter, and the sweet, varying
expression of her grey-blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
'With what pathos Mrs. Trelawney sang!'
said Goring, as after their little promenade
they drew near the French window again.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; one might have thought she was
singing that queer song of herself.  There
seemed somehow a kind of wail in it, as if
it came from the heart.  But we must go in
now.'
</p>

<p>
'One moment yet,' said he, pausing and
almost touching her hand; 'I am so happy
to be alone with you that I grudge every
opportunity you give to others.'
</p>

<p>
'It is very good of you to say so,' replied
Alison to this rather confused remark, as
their eyes met with a mutual glance neither
could mistake nor ever forget; 'but the
evening has become very chilly.'
</p>

<p>
And with this commonplace remark,
while her heart was beating wildly with
new, delicious, and hitherto unknown
emotions that made her cheek glow and then
grow very pale, Alison entered the room as
Bevil Goring opened and reclosed the
French window.
</p>

<p>
From that moment she knew that Bevil
loved her; his eyes had told her so, and
young as she was, Alison was able to read
his confession in them.
</p>

<p>
Now Sir Ranald had missed the pair
from the drawing-room during the few
minutes they had been absent, and drew his
own conclusions therefrom, but not so Lord
Cadbury, who had as yet no jealousy; nor
could he dream that any commoner or
poorer person could enter into a competition
with him for anything, assured as he was,
in an absurd degree, of the overwhelming
influence of his own rank and his own
money, which hitherto had always procured
him whatever he had a fancy for.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Trelawney's carriage was
announced by Archie, and that lady was
being shawled previous to her departure,
she made Alison grow pale with annoyance
by whispering as she kissed her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I hope, darling, you have not been
making a fool of yourself?'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Young as you are, you are certainly old
enough to know what officers are!'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you, Laura&mdash;what
are they?'
</p>

<p>
'The greatest flirts in the world.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you found them so?'
</p>

<p>
'I have had more experience of them
than I ever care to have again,' said she,
bitterly.  'Good-bye, Captain Dalton,' she
exclaimed, presenting her hand to the tall,
dark officer who had been regarding her
attentively.
</p>

<p>
'Rather let us say <i>au revoir</i>,' said he
bowing.  'I have with me at the camp a
necklace of Champac beads which I
brought from India, and I have just
promised them to your daughter; if you will
permit me to send&mdash;or to call&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'We shall be so happy to see you&mdash;but
you are too kind, and are you not
depriving some other little, or fairer friend&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No, Mrs. Trelawney; I have scarcely a
lady friend in the world now,' said he,
laughing, though his speech seemed a grave
one.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes after and the little party
had separated; Lord Cadbury remained
behind, to the intense annoyance of Goring,
who, with his two companions, went back
to the camp at a canter to be in time for
mess; and while Sir Ranald&mdash;Cadbury's
senior by some fifteen years&mdash;dozed and
slept after dinner in his easy chair, Alison,
till she was weary and well-nigh desperate,
had to undergo the prolonged visit, the
society, and the unconcealed tenderness, or
would-be love-making, of her odious old
admirer.
</p>

<p>
When Alison retired that night, Bevil's
rosebud was carefully placed in a flower
glass upon her toilette table, while
Cadbury's Provence rose was left to repose in
the coal-scuttle; and Bevil Goring, in his
hut in the infantry lines&mdash;a hut in which he
chummed with Jerry Wilmot&mdash;lay awake
far into the hours of the morning, till the
cannon announcing dawn boomed from
Gun Hill over the sleeping camp, thinking
again and again of the little promenade
round the old house at Chilcote, the eyes
that had looked so sweetly into his; of the
little he had hinted&mdash;still more of the vast
amount he had left unsaid, and marvelling
when again he should see Alison Cheyne.
</p>

<p>
The fact is that Bevil Goring was very
much in love&mdash;certainly more than he had
ever been in his life before, and frankly
confessed to himself that he had been 'hit
at last, and hit very hard indeed.'
</p>

<p>
Thus it may be imagined how much he
felt stung when next day at breakfast,
while the trio were talking of the day
before, Dalton said, quite unwittingly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Trelawney assured me that it is
almost completely arranged that Miss Cheyne
is to become the wife of Lord Cadbury,
who can make a princely settlement upon
her; while her father is, we all know, so
poor.'
</p>

<p>
'What selfishness&mdash;what sacrilege!'
exclaimed Jerry, slashing the top off an egg,
'to sacrifice her to that old duffer!'
</p>

<p>
'For her father's sake I have little doubt
the girl will comply&mdash;she seems of a most
affectionate nature.'
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring sat silent; but these
remarks sank deeply into his heart.
</p>

<p>
'Does Mrs. Trelawney approve of these
arrangements?' asked Jerry, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say&mdash;but I should rather think not.'
</p>

<p>
'To me she seems to have been singularly
unhappy in her short married life.'
</p>

<p>
'What makes you think so?'
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely know&mdash;but feel certain that I
am right.'
</p>

<p>
'Now wouldn't you like very much to
console her, Jerry?'
</p>

<p>
'You are the last man, Tony, in whom I
would confide concerning the fair widow,'
said Jerry, angrily; 'but there goes the
bugle for parade, and, by Jove, our fellows
are falling in!'
</p>

<p>
'When her hair is grey&mdash;if it ever becomes
grey&mdash;and all her youth is gone, that
woman will still be beautiful,' exclaimed
Dalton, with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney was wont to drive over
every other day when the weather was fine
and take Alison&mdash;she knew the lonely life
the girl led&mdash;away with her to afternoon
tea, to lawn tennis at the Vicarage or
elsewhere, or drive by Farnborough and
Aldershot Camp.  And, with reference to future
points in our story, we may add that this
sprightly lady resided at Chilcote Grange, a
pretty modern villa about a mile distant
from the mansion of Sir Ranald, whither
she had recently come after a long sojourn
abroad, or in the Channel Islands, as some
said, for no one knew precisely about her
antecedents.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all her real, or pretended,
aversion to matrimony, and love of
that freedom which the demise of 'the late
lamented Trelawney' seemed to have given
her, the handsome widow, by more than
one mutual invitation to her 'afternoon
teas,' &amp;c., unknown to Sir Ranald and Lord
Cadbury, gave Bevil Goring an opportunity
of meeting Alison Cheyne which he might
not have otherwise enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
Alison had read of love and thought of it
(as what young girl does not?), and Bevil
Goring seemed to her the beau-ideal of all
she had pictured in her imagination a lover
or a husband ought to be.  True it is, this
idea might be born of his undoubted fancy
for herself, and the impulsive nature of
Alison forbade her to love or do anything else
by halves.
</p>

<p>
Already she thought of him and spoke of
him to herself as 'Bevil,' and then paused
and blushed at the conviction that she did
so.  But then was not the name a quaint
and strange one?
</p>

<p>
Dalton had called at Chilcote Grange and
left his card; the widow was from home,
and, as he did not leave the gift he had
promised her little daughter, she smiled,
as she well knew that he meant to call
again.
</p>

<p>
'Laura,' said Alison, as she saw the card,
'I am certain that Captain Dalton admires
you&mdash;Nay, loves you, from what Bevil, I
mean Captain Goring, tells me.  He talks
of you incessantly.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet he has only seen me once or twice.'
</p>

<p>
'Quite enough to achieve that end.'
</p>

<p>
'How, child?'
</p>

<p>
'You are so very beautiful,' said Alison,
patting the widow's cheek playfully.
</p>

<p>
'How strange that you should say so!'
</p>

<p>
'Why strange?'
</p>

<p>
'I mean that one woman should so much
admire another.  Had you been a man it
might be natural enough, and understandable too.'
</p>

<p>
'But why not a woman?' persisted Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Women are often too petty&mdash;too jealous
generally of each other; but you are a dear
pet, Alison, and admire those whom you
love.  As for Dalton, he has seen so little
of me&mdash;here at least.'
</p>

<p>
'What! has he met you <i>elsewhere</i>?' asked
Alison, quickly.
</p>

<p>
'No; I have not said so,' replied
Mrs. Trelawney, colouring deeply for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'But your words seemed to imply this, Laura.'
</p>

<p>
'They implied nothing&mdash;I scarcely know
what I said; but as for praising me, Alison,'
said Mrs. Trelawney, to turn the conversation
apparently, 'you can well afford to do
so; but if I were to be denuded of my
borrowed plumes, my gay dresses, and general
make-up, I might cut a sorry figure perhaps,
while you in the bloom of your girlhood&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Require all that bloom, Laura; if my
good looks, and the impression they may
make, depended on all the finery poor papa
can give me, I should cut but a sorry figure
too.'
</p>

<p>
Then both laughed as they turned to the
mirror above the mantelpiece, that
reflected two faces, which, though different in
style, contour, and colour, were both lovely
indeed, and the owners thereof felt that
they were so.
</p>

<p>
From thenceforward no solicitation could
prevail upon Alison Cheyne to ride one of
Lord Cadbury's horses again, passionately as
she loved equestrian exercise; and her
persistent refusal greatly puzzled the amorous
peer, and annoyed Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
Two longings grew strong in the girl's
heart&mdash;one to be rich and independent of
all monetary considerations, as her family
once was; the other, that her father would
moderate his ambition to their present
circumstances, and cease repining; but pride
made him revolt against them, as not being
the inevitable, while she had&mdash;as he thought&mdash;a
well-gilded coronet lying at her feet.
</p>

<p>
As to any secret fancies Alison might
have, or her 'chance-medley' friend Captain
Goring either, he barely gave them a
minute's consideration, as being too
preposterous, if indeed he considered them at all.
</p>

<p>
Goring had no one to consult or regard&mdash;father,
nor mother, nor brother; he was
alone in the world now, and the entire
master of his own means, if somewhat slender,
and he longed now indeed for some one
to love, and love him in return.
</p>

<p>
He brooded over the past, and it was a
strange coincidence that he should have
worn for so long a time, in that far away
land of the sun, Ellon's ring with her hair
and her likeness in it, all unknown to
himself; and of that circumstance he was never
weary pondering, and drawing therefrom
much romantic and lover-like comfort.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to establish a link&mdash;a tie&mdash;between them!
</p>

<p>
But Bevil remembered what he had seen
of Cadbury at Chilcote; this latter's presents
incidentally referred to; his proffered
mounts, and, more than all, the observations
of Mrs. Trelawney and others; hence his
tongue was tied and his heart seemed to die
within him.  What had he compared with
Cadbury to offer worthy the consideration
of a man like Sir Ranald Cheyne?
</p>

<p>
He had not been slow to divine, to
detect, the footing on which the former
stood with the latter&mdash;a proud, impoverished,
and embittered man, and a lover's
active imagination, full of fears and doubts
and jealousies, did the rest.
</p>

<p>
He actually avoided Chilcote, for he
knew that any intercourse there would be
restricted and restrained.
</p>

<p>
'To meet her again and again is only
playing with fire,' he thought.  'For her
own sake and mine it is a perilous game.'
</p>

<p>
But the moth would go to the candle, and
while avoiding Chilcote he often rode over
to the Grange, where, however, he never
had yet an opportunity of seeing Alison
quite alone, for, if no one else was present,
she had always little Netty Trelawney
hovering about her or hanging on to her
skirts.
</p>

<p>
When he did fail, as sometimes happened,
to see Alison, he was almost glad and yet
sorry, for her pale and thoughtful face
haunted him and filled his heart with a great
longing to comfort her, for somehow he
thought she wanted comfort, and to tell her
of his love, though the matter should end
there, and she tell him to go&mdash;go&mdash;and
never address her again, as he too surely
feared that the story of his love was one she
dared not, must not, listen to.
</p>

<p>
One day&mdash;he never forgot it&mdash;he was
leaving the Grange, walking slowly, with
the bridle of his horse over his arm, when
he came suddenly upon her of whom his
thoughts were full, about to enter the gate
from the roadway.
</p>

<p>
'Alison!'
</p>

<p>
The name, all softly uttered, and with
infinite tenderness, seemed to escape him
unconsciously as he lifted his hat.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Goring,' said Alison, looking
up, her pleasure blending with alarm in her
face, 'you must not call me thus.  What
would people think?'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me,' said he, as he took her
hand, while colouring nearly as deep as
herself.  To resist improving the unexpected
opportunity, however, was impossible, so
after a little pause, he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'It seems an age since I saw you last.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't exaggerate, Captain Goring.  We
met at Laura's only four days ago.'
</p>

<p>
'Four centuries they have seemed to me.
I suppose you walk often in these beautiful
woods of Chilcote?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes, in summer especially; but the
leaves are nearly gone now.'
</p>

<p>
'And in autumn&mdash;where?'
</p>

<p>
'In the woods too; but in the broad walk
that leads towards the church.'
</p>

<p>
'The walk with the stately old beeches?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
It was the vista she had shown him from
the little terrace.
</p>

<p>
'And <i>when</i> do you generally go there?'
he asked, in lower voice, while his hand
closed over hers.
</p>

<p>
'A little before noon,' she replied, in a
whispered voice.
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow, then,' said he, seeking for
the eyes that now avoided his, and with a
heart beating lightly he galloped along the
road towards the camp.
</p>

<p>
Next day Alison sought her usual walk
with a strange palpitation in her bosom, as
if something was about to happen; and she
had a timid fear of being seen&mdash;of being
watched like one who was about to commit
a crime&mdash;a great error perhaps; and yet for
the life of her she could not fail to keep the
appointment, for such her poor little heart
told her it was.
</p>

<p>
The day was wonderfully bright and
beautiful for the season; streaming through
the giant beeches the rays of the sunshine
quivered on the green grass and brown fern;
there was a hum of insect life still, and the
twitter of sparrows, while an occasional
rabbit shot to and fro.
</p>

<p>
The time passed slowly, till Alison thought
she could hear the beating of her heart; for
it seemed as if she and the rabbits, the
sparrows and the insects, were to have all
the glade to themselves; when suddenly
she heard the gallop of a horse, and in
another moment Bevil Goring had sprung
from his saddle and taken her hand.
</p>

<p>
'My darling, my darling, I knew you
would come,' he exclaimed, with tenderness
in his tone and passion in his eyes, 'may I
call you Alison now?'
</p>

<p>
She did not reply audibly, but the quick
rose-leaf tint&mdash;one of her greatest
beauties&mdash;swept over her soft cheek and delicate
neck, rising even to her little ears while he repeated&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'May I call you Alison now&mdash;my own
Alison&mdash;when I tell you that I love you?'
</p>

<p>
He kissed her tenderly on the forehead,
the eyes, and lips again and again; and, then
suddenly drawing a little way from him,
she covered her face with her white hands
and began to sob heavily.
</p>

<p>
'You love me, don't you?' he asked, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Bevil,' she replied, in a broken
voice; and he, transported to hear his
Christian name for the first time on her lips,
pressed her to his breast, while she submitted
unresistingly, but added, 'I must come
here no more now&mdash;no more!'
</p>

<p>
'Why, my love?'
</p>

<p>
'It is wrong to papa.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely you will see me again, darling&mdash;surely
you will not accept my love and give
me up at the same moment?  I shall speak
to Sir Ranald, if you will permit me.'
</p>

<p>
'Useless&mdash;useless; you would but precipitate my fate.'
</p>

<p>
'Your fate&mdash;what is that?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know&mdash;I don't know,' moaned
the girl, in sore bewilderment, while the
thin aristocratic face of her father, with his
keen, blue, inquiring eyes, gold <i>pince-nez</i>
and all, seemed to rise before her.
</p>

<p>
'I am not rich I know, Alison darling.'
</p>

<p>
'And I have been used to the want of
riches nearly all my life, and now&mdash;now&mdash;I
must go.'
</p>

<p>
'Already!  You will be here to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no; not to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'When?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot, dare not say.'
</p>

<p>
'You are cruel to me, Alison,' he
exclaimed, and with one long, clinging kiss
they separated&mdash;she to run down the wooded
pathway like a hunted hare, and he to
ride slowly off in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
He came to that trysting-place the next
day, however, and the next too, but no
Alison was there, and he could only surmise
wildly, and perhaps wide of the truth, what
detained her.
</p>

<p>
Had she been watched?  Had their
meetings been overseen, overheard?
</p>

<p>
He knew not precisely how it was with
Alison, whom he regarded with a species of
adoration, but deep in his heart sank the
delightful consciousness that his love pleased
her, and that when they did meet again it
should have some firmer basis than that
brief and stolen meeting had given it.  He
now understood much of the shyness and
timidity her manner had of late exhibited.
He hoped now that he also understood the
half veiled light that had filled her
grey-blue eyes at his approach, and the sweet
roseate flush that crossed her cheek, to
leave it paler than before.
</p>

<p>
She would soon learn to love him fully
and confidently, and he would be content
to wait for the coming joy of a regular
engagement.  But how about Sir Ranald
Cheyne's views; how about Cadbury's too
probable offers; how about 'the Fate'
which, with a broken voice, she said the
knowledge of his love for her would but
anticipate?

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
JERRY AND THE WIDOW.
</h3>

<p>
Alison's tears, agitation, and fears,
together with her admission that he
was far from indifferent to her&mdash;the memory
of their mutual kisses, and all that had
passed so briefly, sank deeply into the heart
of Bevil Goring, who thought the secret
terms on which they now were, if they
were to meet again, as he could not doubt,
were ridiculous to himself and derogatory
to her.
</p>

<p>
His natural impulses of honour led him
to think he should at once address Sir
Ranald on the subject; but the girl's dread of
his doing so made him pause.  He thought
he would consult Dalton or Wilmot on the
subject; but the former was on duty, and
the latter was full of his own affairs; for
Jerry, in fact, had made up his mind to
propose&mdash;to Mrs. Trelawney!
</p>

<p>
Jerry made a more than usually careful
toilette that forenoon, and was more than
ever irreproachable in the matters of boots,
gloves, studs, and collar, even to the
waxen flower at his button-hole&mdash;all with
the aid of his soldier valet, Larry O'Farrel,
whom he had just found deep in the
columns of the <i>Aldershot Military Gazette</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Any news, O'Farrel?' asked Jerry, as he
rasped his thick hair with a pair of
ivory-handled brushes to adjust the parting of his
back hair.
</p>

<p>
'Only that the Sultan of Turkey is dead, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce he is&mdash;died of want of breath,
I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir; strangled or something of that
kind, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, O'Farrel, would you like to be
Sultan of Turkey?  The berth would suit
you, for, like the Bradies,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You'd make a most iligant Turk,<br>
  Being fond of tobacco and ladies."'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'Shouldn't mind, sir, if the pay and
allowances was good.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said Jerry, who was in excellent
spirits with himself and the world at large,
'send in your application in proper form
through me as the captain of your company,
and in time I have not the slightest
doubt you will be O'Farrel the First.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry said all this so gravely and impressively
that, though used to his jokes, not a
smile spread over the face of Larry, who
raised his right hand in salute while
standing erect as a pike.
</p>

<p>
He had heard about the Champac necklace
and the proposed second visit of Tony
Dalton, so he resolved to anticipate his
brother officer, to 'turn his flank,' if
possible, for Jerry was never more in love in his
life, or thought himself so.
</p>

<p>
He had been dazzled by the notice the
brilliant widow had taken of himself ever
since the last Divisional Steeple Chase
meeting, at which he first met her, and had lost
'no end' of gloves to her in bets on the
'Infantry Hunt;' her coquettish familiarity,
the rapidity with which she adopted him as
it were, and slid into making him do
errands for her, calling him by his Christian
name or the abbreviation thereof, 'Jerry'
(which sounded so sweetly on her charming
scarlet lips), her <i>œillades</i> and tricks with her
fan when she tapped his arm or cheek therewith,
were all things to think pleasantly of,
and served to encourage him.
</p>

<p>
'Hang it all,' thought Jerry; 'why
shouldn't I open the trenches and make my
innings now?'
</p>

<p>
So he got into his mail-phaeton, and drove
leisurely through the North Camp.  Dalton
was on guard that day, and saw Jerry, of
whose mission he had not then the least
idea, fortunately, as his own mind was full
of Mrs. Trelawney; he gave Jerry a cigar
from his case, exchanged a word or two,
and saw him turn away into Aldershot&mdash;intent
on his own destruction, as some of
the mess might have said.
</p>

<p>
'I am awfully spooney,' thought Jerry,
as he tooled along the level highway, flicking
his high-stepper's ears with the lash of
his whip.  'She is certainly a lovely woman,
and would make a creditable wife to me,
and be quite a feature at all the garrison
balls and cricket matches; but what the deuce
will the mess think of Netty&mdash;of me having
a daughter nearly half as old as myself!
There's the rub!  She is a pretty little
thing just now, but will be awfully in the
way ten years hence, when all my aim in
life may be to marry her to some coal or
iron man, or any fellow that will have her.'
</p>

<p>
And Jerry was laughing softly to himself
at this idea as he drew up at the door of
Chilcote Grange, and threw the reins to his
tiny top-booted tiger.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney was 'at home,' and in a
few minutes Jerry found himself face to
face with her, in all her bloom and radiance,
seated on a sofa in her charming little
drawing-room, the appurtenances of which were
all in excellent taste, so far as couches,
pretty chairs, fragile tables, curtains, lace,
and statuettes could make it, and pretty
landscapes hung on the walls with blue
ribbons in lieu of cords; and then
Mrs. Trelawney's tightly-fighting costume of dark
blue, which showed the exquisite outline of
her bust and shoulders, was perfect, from
the ruche of soft tulle round her delicate
neck to the dainty slippers which encased
her handsome feet.
</p>

<p>
The brightness of her smile encouraged
Jerry, who, after a few well-turned expressions
of pleasure at seeing her looking so
well, lost no time in 'opening the trenches,'
for he was, though a young fellow, a
remarkably cool hand.
</p>

<p>
The widow's bright hazel eyes dilated
with surprise for a moment, and then their
white lids and long silky lashes drooped, as
if to veil the amusement that sparkled in
them, as she withdrew her hand, of which
Jerry had possessed himself, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Mr. Wilmot, are you in earnest?'
</p>

<p>
'Could I dare to be anything else in
addressing you thus?  Earnest&mdash;can you
ask me!&mdash;always when with you, and you
know how much I love you.  Will you marry me?'
</p>

<p>
'My dear Jerry, don't be foolish!  You
are but a boy compared with me, in my
experience as a woman of the world
especially.  It is too absurd!'
</p>

<p>
'If you are older than me at all, it can
only be by a year or two,' said Jerry, who
thought it was not such a difficult matter to
propose as he had first deemed it; 'and so,
dearest Laura&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You must not address me thus.'
</p>

<p>
'But don't you call me Jerry?'
</p>

<p>
'There is a difference, and I may never do so again.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't say so; besides you cannot help
me thinking of you as "Laura"?'
</p>

<p>
'Thought is free, but speech is not.'
</p>

<p>
'You will ever be Laura in my thoughts
and in my heart, whatever you may be on
my lips.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry said this with so much emotion that
Mrs. Trelawney ceased to laugh at him, and
gave her hand, saying,
</p>

<p>
'Jerry, let us be friends; be assured we
can be nothing more, and, indeed, nothing better.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry retained her soft hand lovingly, and,
taking heart of grace therefrom, said,
</p>

<p>
'I shall speak of this matter again, Laura.
I see that I quite deserve your refusal.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I spoke too soon&mdash;too abruptly.'
</p>

<p>
'Believe me, dear Jerry, my answer is a
final one.  I could never bestow on you the
love a wife should feel for her husband.'
</p>

<p>
'That would come in time&mdash;after marriage, Laura.'
</p>

<p>
'No, it cannot be; leave me and forget me.'
</p>

<p>
'That is impossible.  I shall never, while
life lasts, forget you.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney felt an inclination to
laugh again.  She controlled her lips, but
her half-closed eyes were sparkling with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
'I am unworthy the regard I have won.
Thrust me from your thoughts, Jerry, and
forget me, I pray you, forget me,' said she,
emphatically, as she again withdrew her
hand.
</p>

<p>
'I have been a fool!' exclaimed Jerry,
bitterly, as he twisted his dark moustache
and betrayed considerable emotion, at least
for him.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no,' said Mrs. Trelawney, patting his
shoulder with her fan.  'You are no worse
than other men.  You could not help it, if
I was silly enough to be&mdash;shall I say
it?&mdash;amused, perhaps pleased, by all your tender
speeches, though I could not believe in
them.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry stared at her in doubt whether to
be indignant or not, but again her beauty
and <i>espieglerie</i> of manner triumphed.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Laura, once again,' he was resuming,
when she interrupted him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I know all you would say, but please
not to renew this subject, or I shall lose all
faith in you, Captain Wilmot.'
</p>

<p>
'Say "Jerry,"' he urged.
</p>

<p>
'Well, then, Jerry, I like you very much,'
she said, coquettishly, and with an infinite
sweetness of tone; 'but I shall be sorry if
your persistence makes me view you differently.'
</p>

<p>
'If you like me so very much, why
cannot you marry me?  You would like me
ever so much more afterwards.'
</p>

<p>
'It is impossible,' said Mrs. Trelawney,
smiling openly now.
</p>

<p>
'Why are you so hard-hearted?'
</p>

<p>
'I am not hard-hearted.  I am indifferent,
that is all&mdash;what I have been made by others.'
</p>

<p>
'What others?'
</p>

<p>
'That is my secret.  But, here come
visitors,' said she, rising and presenting her
hand.  'And let us part, Jerry, as I hope
we shall meet again&mdash;good friends.'
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Jerry was tooling back
to the camp again.
</p>

<p>
'Her manner is deuced mysterious,'
thought he, in great perplexity.  'What
can she mean?  She spoke of herself as
"unworthy," too.  Has she a husband
somewhere, after all?  Oh, the devil!  That
can't be.'
</p>

<p>
'Where have you been, Jerry?' asked
Dalton, who was again loitering in front of
the guard-hut at the camp gate, with a cigar
between his lips, and saw his friend coming
slowly along, with the reins dropped on his
horse's neck.
</p>

<p>
'I have been at Chilcote Grange,' said
Jerry, almost sulkily.
</p>

<p>
'The deuce you have,' said Dalton, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing new in that.'
</p>

<p>
'Calling, were you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and proposing to the widow <i>la belle</i> Trelawney.'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense!' exclaimed Dalton.
</p>

<p>
'A fact though.'
</p>

<p>
'And with what success?' asked Dalton,
his colour changing perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
'None at all, old fellow; bowled out;
thrown over&mdash;I may trust to your silence, I
know&mdash;fairly laughed at me, and won't have
me at any price, by Jove.'
</p>

<p>
'Proposed, and was refused,' said Dalton,
as if speaking to himself.
</p>

<p>
'Proposed right off the reel, whatever
that may mean, and was refused.  But I
don't mean to break my heart over it,' added
Jerry, twirling and untwirling the long lash
of his whip.
</p>

<p>
'And what do you mean to do?'
</p>

<p>
'Make love to some one else&mdash;get tight
at the mess to-night&mdash;tight as a drum.  So
you may go in and win at a canter, if you
choose.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Jerry; but I don't mean to
propose to the widow,' said Dalton, laughing.
'She has some history of her own, I think.'
</p>

<p>
'So do I,' said Jerry, angrily; 'and it is
bad form for women to have histories or
mysteries either.'
</p>

<p>
'Sour grapes, Jerry,' said Dalton, still
laughing.
</p>

<p>
'I thought you were hit a little in that
quarter yourself, Tony; but I am much
mistaken if there is not more in her life than
you know, or any of us is ever likely to
know.'
</p>

<p>
Dalton, though secretly pleased that
Jerry had not met with success, was also
secretly provoked at what he deemed the
young fellow's over-confidence.  He had
felt himself&mdash;he knew not why&mdash;curiously
affected when in the presence of Laura
Trelawney; there was a subtle influence in her
voice and smile that wakened old memories
and strangely bewildered him; and especially
when she sang, these stole over him and
seemed to take tangible form.
</p>

<p>
'And now, I suppose,' said Jerry, as he
manipulated a cigar, 'I must just do as she
probably did when the "late lamented" took
himself off.'
</p>

<p>
'What is that?'
</p>

<p>
'"Drop some natural tears and wipe them
soon," as Milton has it.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll give you another quotation, Jerry&mdash;what
does Abou Adhem say?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't know&mdash;never heard of the fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'"Your lost love is neither the beginning
nor ending of life.  Several things remain
to you.  She is false, and you are the
victim.  Very good.  Nature is not going into
bankruptcy; the sun will rise and set just
the same; corn will grow, birds sing, and
the rain fall just as before.  My experience
is, that it's a toss up that you are not the
better without her, and she not better
without <i>you</i>."'
</p>

<p>
'Likely enough, Tony; but, as "Cœlebs in
search of a wife," I need not go there any
more,' half grumbled Jerry, as he whipped
up his high-stepper and bowled away
through the long street of huts to his
quarters; while to Dalton's graver mind there
seemed to be something intensely comical
in the equanimity with which he took his
repulse.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
'FOR EVER AND FOR EVER.'
</h3>

<p>
Of a very different nature in its depth
and passion was a love-scene which
was taking place not very far distant from
the Grange at about the same time.
</p>

<p>
Alison Cheyne, we have said, had ceased
to take her walk beside the beeches, though
her heart yearned for it, and she knew well
who was too probably loitering and watching
there; so Bevil Goring, at all risks,
wrote her a passionate and imploring letter
to meet him once again at the same place
and hour, with an alternation of days in
case of engagements or interruption; and
this missive came to her when Alison, who
loved him with all her woman's heart, was
wondering hourly how she could get
through day after day without him.
</p>

<p>
'At last! at last!' was the exclamation of
each as the tryst was kept, and they met again.
</p>

<p>
Their hearts were beating fast, and in
unison, but in silence, and, if the meeting
was a secret and a stealthy one, it was all
the more thrilling to both.  They were silent
for a time, we say, but the silence was not
without its eloquence, if the paradox may
be used.  There was the mystic communion
of souls&mdash;the touch of hand that closed on
hand, of lip that clung to lip&mdash;lips that
knew not how to utter all that hovered there unsaid.
</p>

<p>
'You got my letter, darling?' said Bevil,
after a time.
</p>

<p>
'I could not have been here else; but,
for heaven's sake, do not write to me again,'
said Alison, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'For fear of papa; my correspondents
are so few, his suspicions might be excited.'
</p>

<p>
'How hard is this!&mdash;surely we might
write to each other occasionally,' urged
Bevil, caressing her.
</p>

<p>
'No, my dearest; I dislike the idea of a
correspondence that is clandestine, however
romantic it may be; and if papa discovered
it he would deem it so dishonourable in
me&mdash;so dishonourable to himself.'
</p>

<p>
'But you will meet me?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall try, Bevil&mdash;I shall try; oh, I
cannot help coming to meet you now.'
</p>

<p>
'Allow me, darling, till I can place
another there!' exclaimed Bevil, as he
slipped a ring on her engagement finger.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Bevil,'&mdash;but whatever she was about
to say he stopped in a very effectual manner.
</p>

<p>
'You will wear this for my sake,' he whispered.
</p>

<p>
'I will, darling.'
</p>

<p>
'Say always.'
</p>

<p>
'Always, Bevil&mdash;for ever and for
ever&mdash;and&mdash;and,' she added, smiling shyly through
her tears that mingled love, joy, and
something of terror caused to well up in her
beautiful eyes, 'you will take this from me
(I brought it on purpose), poor Ellon's
ring&mdash;the ring you wore so long without
knowing whose face and hair were hidden in it.'
</p>

<p>
'It was an omen of what was to come,
love Alison&mdash;an omen that we were to
meet, and that you should be mine&mdash;mine
only!' he replied, embracing her with ardour.
</p>

<p>
They had now become a little more
composed and a little more coherent.
</p>

<p>
'I have expectations, of course&mdash;every
fellow has,' said Bevil Goring, as they
wandered on slowly hand in hand; 'but mine
are perhaps too remote to suit the views,
and may be opposed to the ambition, of Sir
Ranald; yet I love you so dearly, so
desperately, darling, that if you will wait for
me only a year&mdash;I ask no more&mdash;I shall
hope to claim you publicly or set you free.
A captain with only a hundred or two
besides his pay could scarcely hope to wed
your father's daughter, Alison.  Let our
engagement be a secret one, as you dread
an open one.  It is not honourable in me
to tie you thus, but what can I do?
Separation now would be a kind of death to
me; and oh, Alison, I love you so!'
</p>

<p>
'And I you, Bevil;' then she added, in a
broken voice, 'We have had great sorrow,
great trouble, we Cheynes, and they have
made papa what he is; but I can remember
when things were very different, when we
were not so poor as we are now, and when
he&mdash;poor old darling!&mdash;had much more of
life and spirit in him.'
</p>

<p>
And so, while replying to Bevil's downward
glances of love and tenderness, she
pressed closely to his side, with her fingers
interlaced upon his arm, in the assured
confidence of their mutual relations to each
other, as they sauntered towards a more
sequestered part of the coppice.
</p>

<p>
Let the dark future hold what it might
of severance, tears, and futile longings, for
that fleeting time Bevil was hers and she
was his&mdash;his own!
</p>

<p>
And so they parted an engaged pair, he
not at all foreseeing, and she only fearing,
the gathering cloud that overhung them
both.  Her elderly admirer was in London
then.  Parliament was sitting, and she, freed
from his visits, abandoned herself to the full
enjoyment of the present.
</p>

<p>
She now wore a new ring, a handsome
diamond hoop with a guard, upon the third
finger of her left hand; but this was
unnoticed by Sir Ranald, though it did not
escape the sharper eyes of Mrs. Trelawney,
who more than once caught her young
friend toying with the trinket&mdash;turning it
to and fro round her slender finger, while
regarding it with a sweet, loving, and
dreamy expression of face which told its
own tale.
</p>

<p>
But, if Mrs. Trelawney was reticent on
the subject of her suspicion, Alison was
still more so, and locked her secret in her
own breast.
</p>

<p>
With all the joy of the new position,
however, there was more than one element
in it from which her sensitive nature shrank.
</p>

<p>
First, a secret understanding had been
established between her and a gentleman
friend&mdash;as yet deemed only a visitor at
Chilcote&mdash;unknown to her father and to
others.  Second, it had not been discovered
as yet, but might not always remain so, and
thus eventually cause an <i>esclandre</i>; and to
her it seemed that to make and keep
successive appointments&mdash;sweet and delicious
though they were&mdash;that must be kept secret
was in itself something wrong and unlady-like;
but she was the victim circumstances
had made her.
</p>

<p>
At times it seemed very 'bad form,' as
the phrase went&mdash;a want perhaps of self-respect;
and yet Bevil Goring was so tender,
so loving, so unlike, she thought, every
other man in the world that she must risk
it all, he was so dear to her.
</p>

<p>
And then she would dream of the happiness
it would be if he were openly accepted
by Sir Ranald as her <i>fiancé</i>&mdash;the joy of
seeing him freely come and freely go a
welcome guest at Chilcote, the future member
of her own family, the future prop of her
father's declining years, taking the place of
Ranald and of Ellon; but would such ever&mdash;ever be?
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Bevil Goring, who
was not without a moderate show of proper
pride, was not without some similar thoughts,
and rather resented the position in which
they were placed, giving their solemn
engagement the aspect of a rustic flirtation
with its furtive meetings; and, after all he
had seen of the world, he thought it absurd
for him and perilous for the girl he loved
so tenderly.
</p>

<p>
He called at studied or stated intervals at
Chilcote, but for Sir Ranald ostensibly; and
when in the presence of the latter he and
Alison had to act a part and talk the merest
commonplaces, with the memory in their
hearts and on their lips of passionate and
burning kisses exchanged but an hour perhaps before.
</p>

<p>
They seemed thus to lead two lives&mdash;one
to the world and another to themselves;
but a time was rapidly approaching when a
rough end would be put to all their little
secrets.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Goring seems to send you bouquets
and music pretty often, I think?'
said Sir Ranald, rather suspiciously, one
day.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, papa,' said she, feeling herself
grow pale under the glance he gave through
his inevitable <i>pince-nez</i>; 'our garden yields
so little in the way of flowers, at this
season especially.  I can't afford, you know,
to buy much music, cheap as it is, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'There you go! reminding me of our
poverty again,' said he, in a snappish tone;
'but flowers and music have both meanings&mdash;at
least, they had in my time,' he added,
turning away and thinking, 'I cannot permit
her, for a mere girl's fancy&mdash;if a fancy
she has&mdash;to throw away Cadbury Court and
thirty thousand a year&mdash;egad, no!'
</p>

<p>
Of the City man's coronet he thought
little&mdash;the Cheynes of Essilmont required
no coronets to enhance their old heraldic
glories; but the City man's bank-book and
acquired acres were a very different matter
for consideration now!

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
A REPRIEVE FOR A TIME.
</h3>

<p>
'We dine with Cadbury at the Court
to-morrow&mdash;no party, just
ourselves&mdash;sharp six&mdash;an early dinner,' said Sir
Ranald to Alison, just as she returned from
a meeting with Bevil Goring at the beeches.
</p>

<p>
'Very well, papa,' replied the girl, though
she felt herself shiver with anticipation of
the annoyance to which she might be
subjected; 'has he returned so soon?'
</p>

<p>
'He&mdash;who?'
</p>

<p>
'Lord Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; Parliament has been suddenly prorogued.'
</p>

<p>
In her heart she was sorry to hear it.
'The carriage will come for us punctually,'
he added, regarding her earnestly, as he
thought regretfully&mdash;when did he ever
cease to do so?&mdash;of his own family carriage,
with its hammercloth and heraldic insignia,
and his dismay when Lady Cheyne&mdash;Alison's
ailing mother&mdash;was first compelled to walk
afoot or take a common cab.
</p>

<p>
And old Archie Auchindoir groaned at
the recollection thereof too, when he came
to announce, with a snort, that 'the
Cawdburry machine was at the porch.'
</p>

<p>
Alison sighed as she entered it; an
invitation to dinner was a small affair, but she
felt as if the links of a chain were beginning
to close around her while the easily-hung
carriage rolled on between the hedgerows
in the starlight.
</p>

<p>
'If his lordship makes any proposition to
you to-night, I trust that for my sake, if not
for your own, you will not, at least, insult
him,' said Sir Ranald, breaking the silence
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
'Papa&mdash;insult him!' exclaimed Alison, in
a breathless voice, knowing but too well
that the term 'proposition' meant a
proposal, and her heart seemed to die within
her as she pressed to her lips, in the dark,
Bevil's engagement ring.
</p>

<p>
'For your sake and mine consider well
and favourably his lordship's views,' said
her father again.
</p>

<p>
She remained silent, fearing that the note
her father had received must have contained
something more than the mere invitation to
dinner.
</p>

<p>
'I shall lose the half of my life, Alison,
when I lose you, but I must make up my
mind for it one of these days.'
</p>

<p>
Still she made no response, for her heart
was away in a most unromantic-looking hut
in the infantry lines at Aldershot, where,
in fancy, she saw a handsome young fellow,
his dark hair cropped close, his skin almost
olive in tint, and smooth as a girl's, dark
eyes and straight black eyebrows with thick
lashes, a heavy moustache, and altogether
with a dark manly beauty about him that
would have become the costume of Titian
or Velasquez, like the cavalier brothers in
the portraits at Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
Through the large square entrance-hall
of Cadbury Court, which was panelled with
oak, and hung round above the panelling
with the old family portraits of former
proprietors, and had tall jars of curiously
painted china standing in the deep old window
bays, with a great lantern of stained glass
shining overhead, they were ushered into
the magnificent drawing-room, where Lord
Cadbury, in evening costume, hobbled from
an easy chair to receive them with no small
<i>empressement</i>, for, though his age of ardour
was past, he had not survived that of
covetousness; and among other things now
coveted was Alison, whom vanity prompted him
to seek that he might exhibit her to society
as a conquest.
</p>

<p>
Alison's drapery seemed to have a soft
sweep in it; she held her fair head high; a
scornful curl hovered on her lip, and yet
she seemed a fragile thing to have so haughty
a spirit.
</p>

<p>
She wore again&mdash;for, poor girl, her wardrobe
was most limited&mdash;the lustreless silk
with its rare old lace, and, though harassed,
she looked charming in her pale beauty,
while almost destitute of ornaments, save a
few silver bangles on her slender wrists, for
the family jewels&mdash;especially the Essilmont
diamonds&mdash;were all things of the past, and
had long since found their way to shop
windows in Bond Street; but she wore at her
neck a little circular brooch of snow-white
pearls from the Ythan, near Ellon.
</p>

<p>
The grandeur and luxury which surrounded
the <i>parvenu</i> lord at times irritated Sir
Ranald curiously, though from sheer
desperation and selfishness he longed for the
hour when his daughter should share them;
thus he was sometimes prompted to say
sharp&mdash;almost sneering&mdash;things to his
prospective son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
'My old and infernal foe&mdash;(pardon me,
Miss Cheyne)&mdash;is with me again,' said
Cadbury, as he hobbled back to his seat.
</p>

<p>
'Who&mdash;what?' asked Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
'The gout&mdash;they say it comes with ease
and money.'
</p>

<p>
'With years too, Cadbury&mdash;one can't have
everything as they would wish it,' replied
Sir Ranald, with a gush of ill-humour; 'all
men, we are told, "are on the road which
begins with the cradle and ends with the
grave; and, in some instances, the world
would be better were the distance between
the two shorter."'
</p>

<p>
'Pon my soul, Cheyne, you are unpleasant,'
replied the peer, not precisely knowing
what to make of this aphorism; 'but there goes
the gong for dinner,' and, drawing Alison's
hand over his arm, he led the way to the
dining-room; 'and so you have quite
declined all my offers of a mount, Miss
Cheyne?' said he, in a voice of would-be
reproachful tenderness, 'though I have put
my entire stables at your disposal.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;a thousand thanks.'
</p>

<p>
'Your taste has changed; or are you
weary of the spins round Twesildon Hill and
Aldershot way!  Some of them are pretty
stiff, I believe.'
</p>

<p>
Alison coloured at the, perhaps chance,
reference to Aldershot, but seated herself
on her host's right hand, and made no reply.
</p>

<p>
The slow elaboration of the dinner, with
its many <i>entrées</i> and courses, though it was
perfect from the maraschino to the coffee;
the two tall solemn servants in resplendant
liveries (like theatrical properties) in
attendance upon them, and the silent butler in the
background, all oppressed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Fine old place this of yours, Cadbury&mdash;dates
from Charles II., I believe,' said Sir
Ranald, looking approvingly round the stately
dining-room, and then glancing at his
silent daughter's face; 'it exhibits all the
chastened grandeur that only comes by long
inheritance, and was not built in a day like
the palace of Aladdin.'
</p>

<p>
'It matters little when built,' replied
Cadbury, bluntly, who felt a taunt in the remark,
and knew precisely how Sir Ranald viewed
his recent title.  'It comes to me out of
Cornhill and Threadneedle Street; and I
believe that Miss Cheyne will agree with me
that it is better to have industrious than
expensive forefathers&mdash;hewers of wood and
drawers of water, though some may deem
them.  Bosh!  Sir Ranald&mdash;all men come
from Adam,' added Cadbury, who, though a
peer, was somewhat of a Radical in his
proclivities.
</p>

<p>
'In these points you and I differ,' said Sir
Ranald, stiffly, as he sipped his glass of dry
Moselle.
</p>

<p>
'In this age of the world, a fellow with a
pedigree is exactly like a potato,' said Lord
Cadbury, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'How do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'That the best part of the plant is underground.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald coloured with annoyance up to
his pale temples, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I am astonished that you should indulge
in such bad form as proverbs; and, as for
pedigrees, I never knew any man undervalue
them if he ever had one&mdash;real or
pretended&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Alison, fearing the conversation was taking
an unpleasant turn, looked at her father
imploringly, and said, with her brightest
smile,
</p>

<p>
'You know, papa, that in this work-a-day
age, merit is better than birth.'
</p>

<p>
'And what is the best test of merit?'
asked their host.
</p>

<p>
'Success,' said Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Precisely.'
</p>

<p>
'Not always,' said Sir Ranald; 'sometimes
a defeat may be as glorious as a
victory.  Was it not said of the clans at
Culloden that in great attempts it is glorious
even to fail?'
</p>

<p>
And now, as dinner proceeded, Alison,
surprised by the peevish pride of her father,
after his warnings in the carriage&mdash;notwithstanding
the fears with which these warnings
had inspired her&mdash;with all a woman's
tact, exerted herself to turn the conversation
to other subjects, and addressed herself
so much to her old host that he gathered
hope and courage, and his face beamed
with smiles; though his supposed love for
Alison was not much more than a strong
fancy crossed, which enhanced her value
and gave a piquancy to his pursuit of her&mdash;a
fancy that ere long was to be curiously
combined with irritation and revenge.
</p>

<p>
Over the sideboard, which was loaded
with massive plate, hung a great portrait of
Sir Timothy Titcomb, the City Knight and
first peer, in all his bravery of robe and
chain, and aldermanic obeseness of habit;
and Alison, as she looked at it, thought of
some of the stately portraits at Chilcote
of the Cheynes of other days, and of the
manly beauty of the two Cavalier brothers
who fell in battle for the king&mdash;pale,
proud, and scornful, with their lovelocks
and plumed beavers, and the moment dessert
was over, she stole away to the solitude
of the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
She had felt rather lonely during the
protracted meal.  There was no other lady
present.  'Why?' she asked herself; did
not ladies affect the society of the wealthy
and titled bachelor?  It almost seemed so.
</p>

<p>
During the meal and dessert, Alison,
though her sweet face wore forced smiles,
had a bitter and humiliating sense of how
her father, when his peevishness subsided
under the influence of good wines, changed
in manner, and, with all his inborn and
inordinate pride of race and utter contempt
for <i>parvenus</i> and <i>nouveaux riches</i>, seemed to
make himself subservient to Lord Cadbury,
assenting in the end to his views on everything.
</p>

<p>
She seated herself at the piano, but did
not play, lest, though she had begun a
melody of Schumann's, the 'Nachtstück,'
Lord Cadbury might deem the sound a
hint that she wished him by her side, and,
giving way to thought, she sank into reverie.
</p>

<p>
As she looked on the splendour and
luxury with which she was then surrounded,
it was impossible for the young and
impulsive girl not to think how pleasant it
would be to see no more of duns, and
debts, and genteel poverty; to be the
mistress of Cadbury Court; to own such a
glorious double drawing-room wherein to receive
her visitors; to wear wonderful toilettes;
to be always surrounded by so many curious
and beautiful pictures, cabinets, and
statuettes; to have an assured position
beyond her own&mdash;the position that money
alone can give; to be the mistress of these
magnificent park lands, preserves, and
pastures; the hot-houses and stable-court; the
terraces, with their peacocks and rosaries,
all whilom part of the heritage of a proud
old race that, like the Cheynes of Essilmont,
had come down in the world; to
shine in society, and have always a full
purse to buy whatever she fancied; but to
have all these with Lord Cadbury&mdash;not
Bevil Goring, as her husband!
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;no! she shivered, and thrust aside
the thoughts a momentary emotion of
selfishness was suggesting, as treason to him
whose ring was on her finger, and
exclaimed, as she pressed it to her lips:
</p>

<p>
'Oh, that but a tithe of these things were
my poor Bevil's!'
</p>

<p>
She had been too deeply sunk in thought
to hear the opening and closing of the
drawing-room door, when Lord Cadbury
entered alone, having left Sir Ranald
dropping into his after-dinner doze in the
smoking-room.
</p>

<p>
There was a listless droop&mdash;an
unconscious pathos in the attitude of the girl that
struck even Lord Cadbury, and though a
kind of child, as he deemed her, she was a
stately one&mdash;a stately girl, indeed, when she
chose.
</p>

<p>
The proposal he had come to make was
hovering on his lips; but a consciousness of
his years on one hand, and the girl's youth
on the other, rendered him suddenly diffident.
</p>

<p>
'It is coming now, I suppose&mdash;coming at
last&mdash;this odious, absurd, and insulting
proposal!  Of course papa and he have
arranged all that over their wine and nuts!'
thought Alison, with annoyance and anger
at her host, and no small dread of her
father, who, finding her silent during the
first courses of dinner, had rallied her on
her abstraction.
</p>

<p>
Whatever he had come to say, something
in the expression of her half-averted face
crushed all the hope that wine had raised
in Cadbury's heart, and, seating himself by
her side, he could only make some little
apology for leaving her so long alone, and
regret that he had not time to invite some
other lady friend.
</p>

<p>
He then drew a little nearer her, and,
noting that she had a couple of tea rosebuds
in her collarette, said insinuatingly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I saw that your papa is wearing one of
your favourite flowers at his button-hole&mdash;may
I have one also?'
</p>

<p>
'You are not papa,' she replied, curtly,
to her half-century Romeo; 'such little
decorations seem suitable only for young
folks,' she added, 'but I shall give you a
bud with pleasure.'
</p>

<p>
And quickly her little hands put a rosebud
into the peer's lapel, but in a mechanical
and task-work manner, while there was
an expression on her lips&mdash;and full, delicate,
and emotional lips they were&mdash;and in her
small, pale face, with its decided little chin,
that prevented him from greatly appreciating
the gift as a younger man would have
done; so the attempt even at flirtation fell
flat.
</p>

<p>
'Papa does so love tea-roses; we used to
have such lovely ones at Essilmont,' said
Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Your poor papa!' said Cadbury, softly,
'when you marry, how lonely he will be!'
</p>

<p>
Alison shrank back uneasily, as she
thought of Bevil Goring, and replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I don't mean ever to marry.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed! why so cruel to some one in
particular? and why in any sense?'
</p>

<p>
'I could never leave dear old papa in
our&mdash;our changed circumstances; we are so
much to each other.'
</p>

<p>
'But, in marrying, you need not lose him.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't think he would care to share me
with another.'
</p>

<p>
'How absurd, Miss Cheyne!'
</p>

<p>
'I mean to devote myself to him always.
He is the only <i>old</i> man I shall ever care for;
the only old man worth giving up my life
to.  Well,' added Alison, mentally, 'that is
pretty pointed surely; if he does not take
that hint, he will never take any.'
</p>

<p>
'But your papa cannot live for ever,' said
Cadbury, not unwilling to inflict a thrust in
return.
</p>

<p>
'How cruel of you to remind me of that!'
exclaimed the girl, her fine eyes suffusing
for a moment.  'I know that he is some
years older than yourself; but I hope he
may live to the age of Old Parr!'
</p>

<p>
References to his years, even when he
drew them on himself, always stung her
elderly adorer, who felt his own inborn
coarseness too, as compared with her serene
air of distinction; for Alison Cheyne, even
when provoked to say that which for her
was a sharp thing, always looked <i>pur sang</i>
from her bright brown hair to her tiny
feet.
</p>

<p>
The absence of even one lady to meet her
had surprised the girl; but she knew not,
and neither did Sir Ranald, owing to the
isolated life he led at Chilcote, that, though
fair ones from London were not unfrequent
visitors at Cadbury Court, they were of a
style that the ladies of the county declined
to meet on any terms, which may give our
readers a new insight to the general
character of this hereditary legislator.
</p>

<p>
Quiet though his tone and bearing, in his
past life the man had been&mdash;nay, was
still&mdash;secretly a coarse libertine and a <i>roué</i>, who
indulged in all the vicious propensities which
his ample wealth enabled him to do.
</p>

<p>
Alison Cheyne was his last fancy, and he
was determined, by fair means or foul, by
marriage or trepan, that his she should be.
Her father's poverty and pride, his age and
growing infirmities, could all be utilised to
this end, and nothing now gave him doubts
of easy success but his own years, his grey
hairs, and perhaps&mdash;her love for another.
</p>

<p>
'You do not wear many rings, Miss
Cheyne; but such a hand as yours requires
no ornament.'
</p>

<p>
He took her little white hand in his as
he spoke&mdash;it was her left one&mdash;and
regarded it admiringly; and Alison, though
trembling for what might now ensue, did
not withdraw it.  She thought, was not the
man quite old enough to be her father?
</p>

<p>
'I believe greatly in pretty hands,' said
he, caressing and patting with his right hand
the little white one that lay in his left.
</p>

<p>
'So does papa.  It is a hobby of his that
they indicate race or culture,' replied Alison,
smiling now.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the short, thick digits of Lord
Cadbury showed neither, and, poor man, he
thought so, for he winced at the girl's reply,
it was so like one of Sir Ranald's remarks;
and the gentle Alison blushed that she had
made it.  To do so was altogether unlike
herself, but she was irritated by the whole
situation.
</p>

<p>
'That is a charming ring!' said her host,
touching Bevil Goring's gift&mdash;the gift she
prized beyond her own life.
</p>

<p>
She drew her hand away now.
</p>

<p>
'I have in that casket a diamond hoop
with opals alternately&mdash;one of remarkable
size and value&mdash;and if you would permit
me to offer it&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no, never&mdash;thanks!' she exclaimed,
growing quite pale.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' he asked, with annoyance and surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Opals are unlucky.'
</p>

<p>
'Unlucky?  This is some Scotch superstition, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'It is Oriental, I believe.  Moreover, I
have no wish for more rings, and never
accept gifts of that kind,' she added, with
some hauteur of manner.
</p>

<p>
'I think I startled you by my entrance,'
said he, trying to recapture her hand again;
but she kept them both resolutely folded before her.
</p>

<p>
'I was in a reverie, certainly.'
</p>

<p>
'And, posed as you were, made a most
fairy-like picture,' said he, with his head on
one side, his long white moustache almost
touching her, and more decided tenderness
in his tone than he had ever before adopted.
</p>

<p>
'A fairy&mdash;would I were one!' said Alison,
a little impatiently, with a flash in her
dark blue eyes, for she was in great dread
of what might follow now.
</p>

<p>
'And what would you do if you were
one in reality?' said he, passing a hand
caressingly round her soft arm.
</p>

<p>
'Do?  As Robin Goodfellow, "the knavish sprite," did.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'By one wave of my wand I should
punish you for disturbing me.'
</p>

<p>
'In what way?'  He had interlaced his
pudgy fingers on her arm now.
</p>

<p>
'By garnishing you, as he did, with
Bottom's ears,' she replied, with something
between a laugh and an angry sigh, 'though
I should decline to take the part of either
Titania or Peasblossom.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury released her arm and drew
back; he knew not precisely what she
meant, but tugged his white moustache and
thought&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce does she mean by
Bottom's ears?'
</p>

<p>
It sounded like a rebuff, anyway, and as
such he accepted it&mdash;or rather resented it.
</p>

<p>
'Do compliments displease you?' said he,
becoming insinuating again; 'they are but a
form of kindness.'
</p>

<p>
'I take them from you as I would from
papa; they pass thus, although a younger
man might offend.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury, whose head was stooped towards
her, erected it, lest her glance might
be falling on the little bald patch which he
was so terribly conscious of being apparent
now, and he shivered with annoyance, and
felt wrathful at the girl he was so desirous
of pleasing.
</p>

<p>
'Will you sing for me?' said he, after a
pause, 'I am so fond of music.'
</p>

<p>
'What shall I sing?' asked Alison, seating
herself at the piano, and glad to change
the tenor of a conversation in which she
felt herself ungracious.
</p>

<p>
'One of your Scottish&mdash;one of your national songs.'
</p>

<p>
'"Auld Robin Gray?"' she asked, mischievously.
</p>

<p>
'No, anything but <i>that</i>.  I am sick of it.'
</p>

<p>
She thought for a moment, and then
dashed into another, of which one verse will
suffice, and which was quite as objectionable
to his lordship, though he did not understand
it all.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'There's auld Robin Morris that dwells in yonder glen,<br>
  He's the king o' a' guid fellows and choice o' auld men,<br>
  He has gold in his coffers, he has oxen and kine,<br>
  And one bonnie lassie&mdash;his darling and mine.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'It is a man's song,' said Alison, when she
had concluded the five verses, and continued
to idle over the keys.
</p>

<p>
'And I suppose auld Robin Morris might
be twin brother to the other Robin,' said
Cadbury, with ill-concealed annoyance, as
he conceived there was more in the song
than his ear detected.
</p>

<p>
'It only tells the old story, my lord&mdash;the
hopeless love of a handsome young fellow
for a rich and lovely girl&mdash;an old man's
pride and avarice standing in the way&mdash;'
said Alison, with a soft smile playing about
her lips, and thankful that her father's
entrance put an end to a most obnoxious
<i>tête-à-tête</i>.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later and Lord Cadbury's
carriage was conveying them home, but even
then Alison's annoyances did not cease.
</p>

<p>
'Did Cadbury say anything particular to
you, Alison dear, when I was having a nap
to-night?' asked Sir Ranald, suddenly
breaking a silence that was rather oppressive.
</p>

<p>
'No, papa.'
</p>

<p>
'No!  Nothing?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing of consequence.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he not propose?'
</p>

<p>
'Papa, how can you think of such a
thing?  He is a veritable Grandfather
Whitehead.'
</p>

<p>
'Think of happiness,' said her father, sharply.
</p>

<p>
'Has wealth aught to do with that?'
</p>

<p>
'A good deal&mdash;if not all.  Think of living
in a house like that we have just left!
Think of presentation days, collar days, at
Buckingham Palace, the Park, the Row, the
Four-in-Hand Club by the Serpentine&mdash;luncheons
at Muswell Hill, and so forth!'
</p>

<p>
Alison was silent, but full of sad and
bitter thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Around her&mdash;or within her reach&mdash;she
knew were gaieties in which she could have
no part&mdash;the opera, the Row, the Queen's
drawing-room, to which, notwithstanding
her real social position, she could no more
have access (without the aid of a most
trustful milliner), than the daughter of a clown.
But she did not repine, as her father did,
that she should be debarred from all these
sights and circles, so she replied,
</p>

<p>
'Papa, as I have often said, one can live
without these accessories and surroundings.
I have before urged you to quit even
Chilcote, and let us go home&mdash;home to
Essilmont&mdash;or what remains of it,' she added, in
a broken voice, as she thought of Bevil Goring,
and how a new light, bright as summer
sunshine, had fallen on her life at Chilcote
now.
</p>

<p>
'Home!' exclaimed her father, bitterly,
'home to the crumbling mansion amid the
bleak braes where the Ythan flows, to be a
source of local marvel and pity in our
impoverished state.  No&mdash;no! better our
obscurity in Hampshire; who cares about us
here, or thinks about us at all, unless it's
Cadbury, who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, papa?' asked the girl, passionately.
</p>

<p>
'Would gladly make you his wife, my
darling, and render my old age easy, with
some of the luxuries we possessed in other
times.'
</p>

<p>
Alison shuddered at the suggestion, and
again pressed her engagement ring to her
lips, as if its presence were a charm, an
amulet, a protection to her.
</p>

<p>
'It is his dearest hope that you may yet
journey together through life,' urged Sir
Ranald.
</p>

<p>
Alison thought that a good part of
the peer's journey had been performed
already.
</p>

<p>
But no more passed.  They had reached
home, and, slipping his last crown piece into
the palm of the servant who opened the
carriage door and threw down the steps,
Sir Ranald led his daughter into their
home, which looked strangely small and
gloomy after the mansion they had just
quitted.
</p>

<p>
Alison felt that she had achieved a species
of escape or reprieve, but it was only for a
time.  She felt certain that from first to
last the dinner had been a concerted
scheme, and that somehow, thanks perhaps
to her own <i>brusquerie</i>, her elderly adorer,
natheless his rank and wealth, had lost
courage for the time.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
CAPTAIN DALTON.
</h3>

<p>
We have said that Tony Dalton&mdash;tall,
dark, and handsome Tony, the
pattern officer of his corps&mdash;had promised
little Netty Trelawney an Indian necklet.
He had duly called with it, and clasped
round the neck of the slender girl a gold
Champac necklace from Delhi, and it is
difficult for those even acquainted with the
<i>chef-d'œuvres</i> of the first European jewellers,
to imagine the beautiful nature of these
necklaces, so called from the flowers whose
petals they resemble.
</p>

<p>
'I know not how to thank you, Captain
Dalton, for your kindness to Netty,' said
the beautiful widow, with her brightest
smile, 'it is much too valuable a present for
a child.'
</p>

<p>
'She will not always be a child, and in
the years to come&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The years to come; she is barely nine,
and at twenty it is difficult to think of what
life may be at thirty&mdash;still more at fifty,' said
she, with a curious emphasis, as her eyelids
drooped.
</p>

<p>
'But, like myself, you are not yet thirty,'
said Dalton, 'hence we are both a long way
off fifty.'
</p>

<p>
After this he rode over occasionally from
the camp&mdash;it was rather an idle time with
him then, before the spring drills of the
next year commenced&mdash;and he seemed
rapidly to establish himself at the Grange as
a friend, and on a better basis than the
younger man, poor Jerry Wilmot, had done,
for the latter name was off even the lady's
visitors' list now.
</p>

<p>
In life and history passages seem to
repeat themselves; thus, just as Dalton arrived
one evening, he heard, through the open
window, the voice of Laura Trelawney
singing the old song before referred to, and
with the strain there came many a memory
he had been striving to forget.
</p>

<p>
'Strange!' he muttered; 'that song again!'
</p>

<p>
Sweet, clear, and sad, as if it was meant
for him, and him alone, her voice seemed
to come floating to him in liquid melody, in
pain and pathos.
</p>

<p>
Then he heard some merry voice, with
which he was familiar; and as he was
ushered into the pretty drawing-room,
wherein Jerry met his doom, for a man who
was evidently fast conceiving a <i>tendresse</i> for
the brilliant Mrs. Trelawney, it was curious
that he should feel a kind of relief&mdash;a kind
of protection for himself, or from committing
himself too far&mdash;in the casual presence
of Alison Cheyne and Bevil Goring.
</p>

<p>
The former smiled brightly, and gave
Bevil a glance of intelligence as Dalton was
ushered in.  It was evidently, both thought,
becoming a case, and Alison was already
beginning to see herself a prospective
bridesmaid and Bevil groomsman.
</p>

<p>
'How curious you should all three visit me
just at the same time,' said Mrs. Trelawney.
</p>

<p>
'I was visiting my poor,' said Alison.
</p>

<p>
'And came to comfort the widow and
orphan on the way.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you many recipients of your bounty,
Miss Cheyne?' said Dalton, for lack of
something else to say.
</p>

<p>
'I have little in my power; but they are
all so grateful and so good.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' said Mrs. Trelawney, 'I don't take
so charitable a view of human nature as you
do, child; if the poor are generally virtuous,
it is because they have not the guineas to be
wicked with.'
</p>

<p>
'One of your wild speeches, Mrs. Trelawney,
I hope,' said Goring; 'my guineas are
few&mdash;thus I have a fellow-feeling.'
</p>

<p>
And, leaving the last visitor and their hostess
to discuss the point <i>tête-à-tête</i>, the lovers
strolled into the now somewhat desolate
garden, where the fallen leaves lay thick;
but their own emotions seemed to brighten
it with all the flowers that ever grew in
Eden, and with the walks they were pretty
familiar with now.
</p>

<p>
'And so you were dining <i>en famille</i> at old
Cadbury's place?' said Goring, as he drew
her hand over his arm and retained it there.
'Was it a slow affair, darling?'
</p>

<p>
'Utterly slow,' said Alison, with a sigh,
while looking into his face with smiling
eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me all about it?'
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing to tell,' replied Alison,
feeling the while terribly conscious that
there was far too much if inferences were to
be drawn; but she shrank from giving pain
to her lover by relating her father's desires
and bluntly-expressed wishes, though she
feared that Bevil was quite sharp enough to
suspect more than he or she admitted, else
whence his questions.
</p>

<p>
And now, lover-like, their conversation,
interesting only to themselves, drifted
rapidly into the never-ending topic of their own
passionate regard for each other, their
future hopes, and certainly most vague plans,
while dusk was closing round them&mdash;the
soft semi-darkness of an autumnal night;
yet it was full of distant sounds, and not a
few sweet scents that mingled with the
heavy odour of the fallen leaves.
</p>

<p>
Alison had tied a little laced handkerchief
over her hair, and her eyes were
beaming upward, sweetly and coquettishly,
as they met the glances of her lover, who
thought she looked like the sweetest picture
ever painted, especially when her long
lashes rested on the paleness of her cheek
when she cast them down.
</p>

<p>
'May I see you home when the time
comes?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Not for worlds, Bevil darling.'
</p>

<p>
'It is so dark.'
</p>

<p>
'But Daisy Prune is to call for me, and
we know all the roads and lanes hereabout
as well as if we had made them.'
</p>

<p>
They were very, very happy just then,
these two&mdash;happy in the security of each
other's love, and could little foresee the
turmoil and misery a little time was to
bring forth for both.
</p>

<p>
By the light of a softly-shaded lamp the
other pair were <i>tête-à-tête</i> in the drawing-room,
maintaining a curious and disjointed
conversation, as if some unuttered or
unutterable secret loaded the tongue of each;
and, truth to tell, the officer, who had led
his men to the storming of more than one
hill-fort on the vast slopes of the Hindoo
Koosh&mdash;who had been wont to pot his tiger
and stick his furious pig in the jungle&mdash;who
had been all over India, from the Sand
Heads of the Hooghly to the gates of
Cabul&mdash;if he had now come on a love-making
errand, was the less self-possessed of the two.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney possessed the rare art of
dressing in such dainty perfection as never
woman did before, he thought; and all her
toilettes seemed to harmonise so much with
the time and place in which he saw them,
and with his own taste.
</p>

<p>
As they conversed on indifferent subjects,
a strange and subtle magnetism drew their
eyes to meet from time to time in a manner
that expressed or admitted much, and yet
no particular word of regard&mdash;still less of
love&mdash;escaped Dalton; but little Netty by
her remarks sometimes made both feel
very awkward, and wish that she was
relegated to the region of the nursery.
</p>

<p>
The child, encouraged by his tender manner
to herself&mdash;more than all, her beautiful
necklet&mdash;often hung with confidence and
familiarity about him, and with pretty
pertinacity questioned him about his past
adventures, where he had been and what he
had seen, if he ever had a wife, and much
more to the same effect, as if his past life
were of interest to her, as it was no doubt
beginning to be to her mamma; and on this
occasion, by a simple remark, she made both
feel quite uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Resting her elbows on his knee, and
planting her little face between her hands,
she looked up in his eyes and said,
</p>

<p>
'Captain Dalton, do you come to see me or mamma?'
</p>

<p>
'I come to see both,' replied Dalton,
smiling as he stroked her bright hair.
</p>

<p>
'But you talk so much more to mamma
than to me.'
</p>

<p>
'You are a little girl, Netty; well?'
</p>

<p>
'That I think&mdash;I think&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?  A penny for your thoughts.'
</p>

<p>
'That you are in love with mamma.  Is it so?'
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, at this remark Dalton
grew very pale, while Mrs. Trelawney,
though she coloured considerably, laughed
excessively at the situation thus created, but
was rather surprised that Dalton failed to
take advantage of it, even to pay her, as he
could easily have done, a well-turned compliment.
</p>

<p>
'Netty seems to have quite a matrimonial
interest in you, Captain Dalton,' said she,
still laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; she has more than once asked me
if I ever had a wife.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney, while her own bright
eyes were partly hidden by the shade on
the globe of the lamp, was keenly scrutinizing
the half-averted face of her admirer.
</p>

<p>
'You have not been always a woman-hater?'
she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I never was&mdash;far from it&mdash;the reverse,'
said he, hastily.
</p>

<p>
'And yet in all those years you have
never fallen in love?'
</p>

<p>
'I never thought of it till I came back to
England.  One does not think of marriage
up country in the land of brown squaws.'
</p>

<p>
'And so you never thought of it?'
</p>

<p>
'Never.'
</p>

<p>
Dalton was colouring deeply now, and she
extracted his answers from him 'as if she
had been extracting his teeth,' as she
afterwards told Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Now, however, under better auspices,
and at home, I may wish to change,' he
began.
</p>

<p>
'Change what?' interrupted Mrs. Trelawney,
with a curious sharpness of tone; 'to
reform?  I have read that we often hear
of a woman marrying a man to reform him,
but that no one ever heard of a man marrying
a woman to reform <i>her</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Dalton felt that his love-making, if love-making
it was, took a strange turn now, and
that she was infusing banter or rebuke into
the conversation.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot comprehend, Mrs. Trelawney,
how it is that when I am with you,' said
Dalton, gravely, with a soft and half-broken
voice, 'there comes back upon me much of
my past life, or rather a portion of it, that
I would fain forget.'
</p>

<p>
'How is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Because you have some strange and
magnetic influence over me, to which I
have not as yet the key.  I have sought to
bury, to forget that past I refer to&mdash;to live
it down&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I have no wish to pry into your secrets,
Captain Dalton, nor to act the part of a
Father Confessor, so pray don't confide in
me,' said Mrs. Trelawney, with a&mdash;for
her&mdash;curious hardness in her usually sweet voice.
'I have read somewhere that life itself, from
the cradle to the grave, is but a kind of
gloaming hour, wherein mortals grope dimly
after happiness, and find it not.'
</p>

<p>
'I would that the happiness of my future
life lay in your hands, Mrs. Trelawney,' said
Dalton, with an expression of eye and tone
of voice there was no mistaking.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney did not reply, but she
smiled with a curiously mingled expression
of triumph, pleasure, and, strange to say,
disdain, rippling over her bright face&mdash;emotions
to which we shall ere long have the key.
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks flushed, her lips curved with
her smile, and for a moment her whole
mien was that of a young girl delighted
with flattery.  Dalton was about to say
something more, when the sudden disdain
that replaced the first expression prevented
him, and she said, laughingly,
</p>

<p>
'I can give the ladies a capital addition
to the creed, Captain Dalton.'
</p>

<p>
'What is it?'
</p>

<p>
'Never to love any man, but make all
men love you; as the song has it, "Love
not&mdash;the thing you love may change;" but
here come Miss Cheyne and Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
'A strange woman&mdash;an enigma, indeed,'
thought Dalton, who had an unpleasant
suspicion that she was secretly deriding the
avowal he had, perhaps, been on the point
of making.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Alison,' she said, suddenly, 'you
remember Bella Chevenix, the handsome,
dashing girl, who always wears rich dresses,
but of green or grey tints, a muslin fichu,
with a yellow rose in it, and so forth.  You
have heard what has happened, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'That she was engaged, or nearly so, to
Colonel Graves?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but he has behaved disgracefully.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'What do you think her family found
out?' she asked, addressing Dalton, to his
surprise.
</p>

<p>
'That he was no colonel at all, perhaps,'
said he.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, worse than that.'
</p>

<p>
'Worse!&mdash;what could be worse?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not care to think, Mrs. Trelawney&mdash;not
knowing the parties&mdash;that he was a
criminal, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Worse still.'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens, Laura!' exclaimed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'And he proposed for her?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; was it not horrible, Captain Dalton?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't appeal to me,' he replied, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
'Bella was at a ball in Willis's Rooms,
dancing with Wilmot, of Captain Dalton's
regiment, while the colonel was there
<i>vis-à-vis</i> with some one else, and Jerry, in the
most casual way, asked her if she knew
Mrs. Graves.  Bella thought he was talking
nonsense, but it turned out to be truth, as there
is a Mrs. Graves; but, as Bella is a professional
beauty, luckily, her affections were
not too deeply engaged.  However, such
affairs are a warning to us all in society.
Don't you think so, Captain Dalton?'
</p>

<p>
But for the shaded lamp, the sudden
paleness that overspread the handsome face
of Dalton would have been apparent to all
at this anecdote of Mrs. Trelawney, who
saw that his eyes drooped, and that not
even his heavy moustache concealed the
quiver of his lip as he took his hat and
prepared to retire.
</p>

<p>
'How strange Captain Dalton looks!' whispered
Alison to Goring, as they were parting.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; poor Tony has become a changed
man, moody and irritable, since he has
known your friend, Mrs. Trelawney.  He
is no longer the quiet, gentle, and
easy-going fellow he used to be.  And now,
once again, good-bye, my darling.'
</p>

<p>
And with a pressure of the hand, a kiss
snatched, all the sweeter for being so, they
parted, knowing when and where they were
to meet again.
</p>

<p>
Whatever was the secret, unrevealed yet,
that hung on Dalton's heart, he left the
house of Mrs. Trelawney with a heaviness
of soul and gloom of manner that were but
too apparent to Bevil Goring.  There was
a baffled and dismayed expression in his
face that made him all unlike his old
soldierly self, and on his lips there was an
unuttered vow that he would go near Chilcote
Grange no more&mdash;a vow, however, that he
found himself unable to keep.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
A WRITTEN PROPOSAL.
</h3>

<p>
'Devilled kidneys, actually,' said Sir
Ranald, in high good-humour, next
morning at breakfast.  'I thought the
anatomy of our butcher's shop seemed
never to include kidneys.'
</p>

<p>
Alison was officiating at the tea-board in
her plain but pretty morning-dress, and was
thinking smilingly of the <i>tête-à-tête</i> in the
twilighted garden the evening before, when
Archie laid some letters before her father,
who glanced at them nervously.  All that
were in blue envelopes he knew instinctively
to be duns, and thrust aside unopened.
One in a square cover, that had
thereon the initial C. surmounted by a
coronet, he knew to be from Lord
Cadbury, and opened, and read more than
once, with a pleased, yet perplexed face,
his brows knitted, yet his lips and eyes
smiling.
</p>

<p>
'From Lord Cadbury, is it, papa?' asked
Alison, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and concerns you.'
</p>

<p>
'Me?'
</p>

<p>
'Intimately.'
</p>

<p>
'In what way&mdash;how?' she asked, with a
heart that sank with apprehension.
</p>

<p>
'By making a formal proposal through me.'
</p>

<p>
'For what?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask, child?  Your hand.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, nonsense?' exclaimed Alison,
growing very pale nevertheless, but in the
desperation of her heart resolved to treat
the matter with a certain degree of levity,
as if too ridiculous for consideration.
</p>

<p>
The truth was that, with all the confidence
given him by his wealth and position,
and all the coolness acquired by many past
but coarse intrigues, he had not the
courage to propose personally to a girl like
Alison Cheyne, but did so thus, through
her father, whose selfishness and impecuniosity
made him, as he was well aware, an ally.
</p>

<p>
'He writes very humbly and modestly
for a man of such wealth and weight in
the country,' said Sir Ranald.  'Do you
wish to see his letter?'
</p>

<p>
'No, papa, I have no interest in the
matter,' replied Alison, faintly.
</p>

<p>
'"She has always permitted me to take
the place of a friend&mdash;better than I
merited," he writes, "but that has been
from the innate goodness of her heart,
on which I know that I have no right to
found the expectations that have drawn
forth this letter."  Very well expressed
indeed,' added Sir Ranald, eyeing the missive
through his <i>pince-nez</i>, 'and he winds
up so nicely about your beauty and the
wealth he can lay at your feet, and so forth.'
</p>

<p>
'And so, papa, I am to deem my face
my fortune?' said Alison, still endeavouring
to make light of the matter.
</p>

<p>
'Not alone.'
</p>

<p>
'What more is there, then?'
</p>

<p>
'You are a Cheyne of Essilmont.'
</p>

<p>
'How ridiculous of this man, who is old
enough to be my father!  And so, papa,
this is my first proposal?'
</p>

<p>
'Your first, how many do you expect&mdash;you
a penniless lass?'
</p>

<p>
'With a long pedigree.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied her father, with growing
irritation, 'how many do you expect of any
kind, as society goes now-a-days?  Consider
this well&mdash;or why consider at all?&mdash;but
accept his offer for your own sake and
mine.'
</p>

<p>
'But without love, papa?' said the girl, softly.
</p>

<p>
'You can't live on that, like the æsthetic
bride in Punch, on her teapot,' exclaimed
Sir Ranald.  'In asking you to marry him,
I rather ask you to marry his house in
Belgravia, his place here in Hampshire,
his equipages, and family jewels, as I
suppose he calls them.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa,' said Alison, proudly and
reproachfully, 'is it you, Cheyne of
Essilmont, who suggest this to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;I, Cheyne of Essilmont and that
ilk&mdash;the bankrupt and the beggar,' he replied,
with a burst of impressible bitterness.
</p>

<p>
'Papa, how can you, so proud of race,
go in for vulgar mammon worship so unblushingly?'
</p>

<p>
'My poverty, but not my will, consents.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought daughters were sold only in Circassia.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all, they sell too in Tyburnia
and Belgravia to the highest bidder, and
surely with all he can give you, all that he
can surround us with, you might be able to
tolerate him as a husband.'
</p>

<p>
But Alison could only think of Bevil
Goring, and interlaced her fingers tightly
beneath the tablecloth.
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing in this world like
riches,' exclaimed Sir Ranald, glancing at
the unopened blue envelopes, and tightening
the silk cords of his sorely frayed dressing-gown.
'What riches give us let us first
inquire.'
</p>

<p>
'Meat, fire, and clothes.  What more?
Meat, clothes, and fire,' said Alison, with a
sickly smile.
</p>

<p>
'Alison&mdash;Miss Cheyne,' said her father,
with increasing asperity.  'This offer of
marriage is a serious matter, and not to be
dismissed thus, by a quip or apt quotation.'
</p>

<p>
'You admit that it is apt?'
</p>

<p>
'I admit nothing&mdash;save that Cadbury has
talked this matter over with me before.'
</p>

<p>
'I suspected as much,' said Alison, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'Thus, if you marry him, I know that
besides making noble settlements upon you
he will&mdash;by a scrape of his pen&mdash;clear off
nearly all the fatal encumbrances on our
Scottish property; and I shall die, in old
age&mdash;as I lived till ruin overtook
me&mdash;Cheyne of Essilmont and that ilk.'
</p>

<p>
'And when you die, papa&mdash;' Alison
began, in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'The estate becomes yours and his&mdash;it is
all one.'
</p>

<p>
('And I have promised to wait for Bevil!'
thought the girl in her heart.)
</p>

<p>
'In the hope that you might yet learn to
love him&mdash;indeed upon the faith that you
would do so yet'&mdash;said Sir Ranald, after a
pause, 'he has made me, kindly and
generously, heavy advances, which I have lost
unwisely, and am totally unable to repay.
How then am I to act?  I can but look to
you to listen to him patiently and, with some
consideration for me, if he speaks of his love
to you again, Alison.'
</p>

<p>
To the latter it seemed that it was always
himself, not her, that he considered in this
proposed matrimonial bargain.
</p>

<p>
The old man was very white; his thin
lips were tremulous with earnestness; his
china-blue eyes lowered beneath the glance
of his daughter, and his naturally proud
heart was wrung with pain at the admissions
he was making.
</p>

<p>
She remained silent.
</p>

<p>
'You can have no previous&mdash;no secret
attachment, Alison?' said Sir Ranald, after
another pause.
</p>

<p>
The existence of one dearer to her than
her own life was ignored in this question.
</p>

<p>
What was she to reply? but reply she
must, as he was eyeing her keenly, and even
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
'Do not be angry with me, dearest papa,
but Lord Cadbury I never, never could
learn to love,' she urged.
</p>

<p>
'And what about this fellow Goring?' he
exclaimed, sternly, as he thought suddenly
of many presents of flowers and music, with
<i>Punch's</i> and <i>Graphics</i>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
'Goring,' she repeated, growing deadly
pale, even to the lips.
</p>

<p>
'It cannot be that you are capable of such
infernal folly and tomfoolery as to be
wasting a thought on <i>him</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'He is different indeed,' said Alison,
almost with anger, but added, 'believe
me, papa, the man I love most in the
world is yourself;' and she nestled her
sweet face in his neck as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
'I have had my suspicions of Captain
Goring for some time past; an empty-headed
military dandy&mdash;handsome, I admit, but
too handsome to have much in him,' resumed
Sir Ranald, angrily&mdash;'a dangler, a
detrimental, who, I have no doubt, in weak
recommendation of himself could say, like
the man in the play, "I have not much
money, but what I have I spend upon
myself."'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa!' exclaimed Alison, who was
blushing deeply now.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me if I wrong you, child,' said
Sir Ranald; 'but in this most serious matter
of your whole future life I cannot, and
must not, be crossed.'
</p>

<p>
Alison felt her heart sinking, for, after
this pointed and sharp allusion to Bevil
Goring, it was pretty plain that his visits to
Chilcote, though supposed to be casual ones
at stated intervals, would have to cease.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald had waited for change of fortune,
for something to turn up, year after
year, as old Indian officers used to wait for
the Deccan prize money, as a means of
liquidating accumulated debt&mdash;means that
never came; and now Cadbury's offer had
come to hand like a trump card in the game
with Fortune!
</p>

<p>
'I cannot live for ever, Alison, think of
that,' said he, after a long silence.
</p>

<p>
Alison had thought of it, and loving, yea,
adoring her father as she did, the fear that
she should one day surely lose him made
her heart shrink up and seem to die within her.
</p>

<p>
She would be alone&mdash;most terribly alone
in this bleak world&mdash;when that event came
to pass; and she recalled the cruel words of
Lord Cadburv, that 'he could not live for
ever,' with peculiar bitterness now.  To
whom, then, could she cling if not to Bevil
Goring?
</p>

<p>
'Shall I write to Cadbury that you say
"Yes," Alison?'
</p>

<p>
There were great, hopeless tears standing
in her dark blue eyes, her quivering lips
were tightly pressed together, and her slender
white fingers were tightly interlaced, as
she replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Papa, I would rather die first!'
</p>

<p>
'And this is your irrevocable answer?'
</p>

<p>
'It is.'
</p>

<p>
Two days passed now&mdash;days of unspeakable
misery to Alison, before whom her
father again and again set all his monetary
troubles, his present misery, and too
probable future ruin, till her heart was wrung
and her soul tortured within her by a
conviction of her own selfishness in not making
a sacrifice of herself and Bevil Goring; but
her love of the latter on the one hand, and
her horror and repugnance of Lord Cadbury
on the other, prevailed, and Sir Ranald
found that he could neither lure nor
bend her to their purpose.
</p>

<p>
After this he wrote a letter to Cadbury
full of expressions of gratitude for the
honour done himself and his daughter (he
snorted when he wrote the word 'honour'),
and with hopes that the latter would yet see
the folly of delay&mdash;(it was, he felt assured,
only a little delay, she would no doubt give
her acceptance).  He felt himself too deeply
in Cadbury's debt even to hint that she had
refused to consider his proposal of marriage
in any way but one&mdash;with dismay and
aversion.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury, however, saw precisely
how the matter stood, for rumours of the
meetings at the beeches had reached him,
and he viciously tugged his long, white,
horse-shoe-like mustaches.
</p>

<p>
Then he tore Sir Ranald's letter into
minute fragments, and with an expression
of anger&mdash;even of malignancy&mdash;-in his cunning
eyes, prepared to take the first train to
town, muttering the while&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'We shall see, my pretty Alison&mdash;we
shall see!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
IN ST. CLEMENT'S LANE.
</h3>

<p>
It was the early dusk of a dull November
day&mdash;a day in which there had not
been even twilight in London&mdash;such days as
are only to be seen there and in Archangel&mdash;when
one of those awful black fogs prevail,
when gas is lighted everywhere, when
all wheel traffic is suspended, when cabs,
'buses, and drays cease to run, and sounds
become curiously deadened or muffled.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury, from narrow Lombard
Street, turned into that narrower alley which
lies between it and King William Street
called St. Clement's Lane, from the ancient
church dedicated to that saint some time
prior to 1309, and for the rebuilding of
which, after the great fire, the parish
bestowed upon Sir Christopher Wren the
curious fee of 'one-third of a hogshead of
wine.'
</p>

<p>
Here now are the close, narrow, and in
many instances mean and sordid-looking
offices of merchants, insurance agents,
bill-brokers, and others, who, however, turn
over vast sums of money in their
humble-looking premises.
</p>

<p>
To this curious quarter of the City Lord
Cadbury had come, with his thoughts
intent&mdash;strange to say&mdash;upon Alison Cheyne!
</p>

<p>
The girl's great loveliness and purity had
fired his passion&mdash;pure love it was not, nor
could it be&mdash;and a sentiment of jealousy,
pique, and more than either&mdash;something of
revenge&mdash;made him resolve, through her
father's means, to bend, to bow, to crush
her to the end he wished!
</p>

<p>
At his years he was more than ever
exasperated by the thought of having a
young and handsome rival like Bevil Goring
to contend with; and much jealousy had
thus made the elderly lover mad with spite
and reckless of consequences; and as he
knew that poverty and shame made Sir
Ranald desperate he resolved to take his
measures accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The longing to break her pride and to
triumph over Goring made Cadbury meanly
revengeful, and thus it was that on the day
in question he went groping towards the
office of Mr. Solomon Slagg, a bill discounter
in this gloomy locality.
</p>

<p>
A narrow passage, closed by a green
baize-covered swing door, led to a room, or
rather den, in which a couple of clerks sat
all day long, and often far into the night,
perched on two high stools, writing in the
same dreary ledgers by gaslight, for the
blessed rays of the sun never found entrance
there all the year round; and in a smaller
den beyond, usually lighted, but dimly, by
a curious arrangement of reflectors, sat
Mr. Solomon Slagg, writing by the light of a
single gas jet, minus shade or glass, but
encircled by a wire guard.
</p>

<p>
The dingy room&mdash;the walls, ceiling, and
bare floor were all of the same neutral kind
of grey tint&mdash;had a little fire-place, wherein
stood a meagre gas-stove.  Above it on
shelves were numerous mysterious-looking
bottles containing samples of wine, and
against the wall were numerous oil-paintings,
placed there, not for ornament, but
with reference to Mr. Slagg's multifarious
modes of doing business and 'doing' the
public.
</p>

<p>
His rather rotund but misshapen figure
was wedged deep in a black leathern easychair
at an ink-spotted desk, whereon lay
piles of battered and greasy-looking ledgers
and day-books.  His bald head was sunk
between his heavily-rounded shoulders; he
had large, coarse ears, a nose like an inverted
pear, pendulous cheeks, to which straggling
grey whiskers were attached, and he
had cunning little eyes that twinkled in
deep and cavernous sockets.
</p>

<p>
Altogether Mr. Solomon Slagg was not a
pleasant person to look upon, but his face,
such as it was, lighted up when he saw his
visitor, to whom he bowed low, without
rising, and to whom he indicated a chair by
a wave of his pen, with which he made a
mark or sum total on a page, and, closing a
small ledger, turned to Lord Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
'Stifling den this of yours,' grumbled the
latter, as he lighted a cigar; 'no objections
to smoking, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'None, my lord.'
</p>

<p>
'A vile day of fog&mdash;utter black fog.
Had the devil's own trouble in making you
out on foot from Moorgate Street Station;
but, you got my letter, of course?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my lord.'
</p>

<p>
'And acted upon it?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my lord,' said Slagg, slowly, 'I
was just about to write&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That you had got up all Cheyne's blue paper.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, in obedience to your directions, I
took up all the acceptances I could trace,
and, as he has been more than once in the
Black List, I wonder that he has been able
to draw bills without some one to back
them.  There is some of his paper,' added
Slagg, pointing to some very crumpled-looking
slips.
</p>

<p>
'Renewed more than once apparently.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! yes&mdash;again and again, in some instances.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor old devil!' said my Lord Cadbury,
with reference to his prospective father-in-law;
'what is the "demmed total," as Mr. Mantilini
would say?'
</p>

<p>
'About a couple of thousand.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury smiled&mdash;the sum was a trifle to
him; but its demand meant utter ruin to
the impecunious Sir Ranald, who could no
more meet his acceptances than fly.
</p>

<p>
'My pretty Alison will find that at Chilcote
she has been living in a kind of fool's
paradise,' thought he, as he tugged his long
white moustache with very great complacency.
</p>

<p>
'You will put all the pressure you can
upon Sir Ranald when these bills fall due&mdash;no
more renewals at any risk; at the same
time it must all appear as your affair, not
mine&mdash;my name must not appear in the
matter.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not, my lord; if it did&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Don't even think of it, for in that case
it would prove my ruin in a quarter where
I wish to be well thought of.'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Ranald Cheyne seems to have been
anticipating his income.'
</p>

<p>
'Till, I suppose, there is nothing more to
anticipate.'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly.'
</p>

<p>
'Good&mdash;good!' exclaimed Cadbury, as
he struck his gloved hands together; 'then
you'll put the screw on him the moment
you can do so.'
</p>

<p>
'Before this week is out, my lord.  There
is one acceptance there for £300 on which
the three days of grace are yet to run, and
then I shall act upon the whole.  Your
lordship gave me <i>carte blanche</i> to acquire all
these documents, and, having done so, your
money must be repaid to you through me.'
</p>

<p>
'Precisely so.'
</p>

<p>
The two shook hands, and again Cadbury
dived into the choking fog, to make his way
westward to his club as best he might,
feeling assured that an unexpected pressure
would now be put upon the luckless Alison,
by means of her father's mental misery and
inordinate pride.
</p>

<p>
He knew how intense was the girl's
devotion to the old man; he knew also that
the latter, with all his love for his daughter,
was not without a considerable spice of
gross selfishness in his nature; that he loved
the good things of this life very much, all
the more that many were gone, and more
might go, utterly beyond his reach, unless
some one interposed to save him; and so
Cadbury chuckled as he thought of the fatal
ball he had set in motion with the aid of
Mr. Solomon Slagg.
</p>

<p>
And that evening, when in the brilliantly
lighted dining-room of his magnificent and
luxurious club in Pall Mall, after a sybarite
repast, with many curious and elaborate
<i>entrées</i>, he drank his Clicquot Veuve and Schloss
Johannisberg, not an atom of compunction
occurred to him for the misery he was
working the poor but proud old baronet,
and the sweet girl, whom, <i>bon gré mal gré</i>,
he had resolved to make his wife.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
AN ENIGMA.
</h3>

<p>
Despite the silent vow he had made,
Captain Dalton could not keep away
from Laura Trelawney, the only woman the
world seemed to hold for him, and yet
whom he had no hope of winning.
</p>

<p>
His was no lovesick boy's fancy, yet it
made him sallow, pale, and worn-looking,
restless in solitude, and taciturn in society,
always seeking for action, not for any tangible
result that action gave, but as a means
of present distraction.
</p>

<p>
The baffled Jerry Wilmot was not slow,
at mess and elsewhere, to note the change
in the generally quiet and even tenor of his
brother officer's general mood, and drew his
own conclusions therefrom, and these were
that he was not progressing favourably in
his suit with the brilliant young widow.
</p>

<p>
'If a widow she really is,' said Jerry one
day after evening parade, when Dalton's
groom brought his horse round to the mess
hut, and he was about to ride over to
Chilcote Grange.
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;what the devil do you mean,
Jerry?' asked Dalton, greatly ruffled.
</p>

<p>
'Only that a rumour is abroad that has
in it a deuced unpleasant sound.'
</p>

<p>
'To what effect?'
</p>

<p>
'That her husband is not dead&mdash;that she
is not a widow at all&mdash;that he ran away
from her, or something of that kind.  Have
you not remarked how she sneers at matrimony?
Egad, I hope she is not <i>divorcée</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense, Jerry; how dare you let
your tongue run on thus!'
</p>

<p>
'Little birds sing strange songs sometimes.'
</p>

<p>
'Sour grapes, Jerry, that is all,' replied
Dalton, laughing, but only from the teeth
outwards, as he rode off to what Wilmot
said was 'his doom.'
</p>

<p>
The rumour&mdash;real or alleged&mdash;so casually
mentioned by Jerry, rankled deeply in
Dalton's mind for a time, but it passed away
when he found himself in the presence of
Mrs. Trelawney, and he saw again her soft
hazel eyes, so delicately lidded, their long
lashes and eyebrows darker than her rich
chestnut hair; her dress that hung in clinging
folds around her and showed her beautiful
form, grandly outlined as that of a classical
statue; and when Antoinette&mdash;or Netty,
as he called her now&mdash;stole her hand, white
as a snowflake and tiny as a fairy's, into his,
and, looking at him with eyes blue as
forget-me-nots, said, 'I love you!' he
stroked the shower of golden tresses
that were held back from the child's brow
by a blue silk riband, and replied, while he
kissed her.
</p>

<p>
'And I love you, Netty, so much!'
</p>

<p>
Her tiny mouth was all a-tremble with
fun and pleasure as she asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'And don't you love mamma too?'
</p>

<p>
He made no answer, but Mrs. Trelawney,
whose eyes had been suffused with tender
pleasure at his kind manner with Netty,
now laughed and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, you <i>enfant terrible</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'I heard you and Alison Cheyne talking
of Captain Dalton the other day and I
thought I should so like him for a papa.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Mrs. Trelawney.
</p>

<p>
'Because I never had one.'
</p>

<p>
'Never had one?' she repeated, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'No; I am the only little girl that never had.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't remember him then?' said
Dalton, recalling the remarks of Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'How can one remember what one
never, never had?' said little Netty,
sententiously.
</p>

<p>
'Go to your nurse, Netty,' said her
mamma, 'I hear her calling for you.'
</p>

<p>
So Netty was summarily dismissed, and
not a moment too soon, as both her listeners
thought, and an awkward pause was about
to ensue, when Mrs. Trelawney said, suddenly,
</p>

<p>
'Your friend Goring seems desperately
smitten with my sweet little friend Alison
Cheyne.'
</p>

<p>
'If so, I wish him all success,' replied
Dalton.  'Goring is the king of good
fellows, and the girl is quite beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'The French have a curious saying that
it is not necessary to be beautiful in order
to be a beauty; but Alison Cheyne is indeed
lovely, and has, in a high degree, a lady-like
dignity about her; and, with it, is so
charmingly simple and <i>piquante</i>.  I hope
Goring is rich; her father, I am pretty sure,
looks forward to a wealthy alliance for her.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, in that case, I fear poor Bevil
will be out of the running,' said Dalton;
'he has some expectations, I know, but
they are very remote, I fear.  We cannot,
however, control our hearts, nor, when in
love, do we care about calculating eventualities,'
he added, very pointedly, while taking
Mrs. Trelawney's delicate and shapely little
hand between his two, but she withdrew it,
and, while discharging a whole volley of
expression by one flashing <i>œillade</i> of her
hazel eyes, she exclaimed, laughingly,
</p>

<p>
'Take care, Captain Dalton, or I shall
be led to infer that you are falling in love
with me.'
</p>

<p>
'You know that I have done so&mdash;that I
have loved you since the first moment we
met.'
</p>

<p>
She was laughing excessively now, and
Dalton felt that a lover laughed at had
little hope of success, so he said, gravely,
</p>

<p>
'I hope you are not playing fast and
loose with me and my friend Wilmot.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you no better opinion of me,
Captain Dalton?'
</p>

<p>
'He gave me to understand that you
declined his addresses.'
</p>

<p>
'Whatever they may be&mdash;yes,' replied
the smiling widow, 'but I would not have
mentioned the matter, as he seems to have
done&mdash;poor Jerry!'
</p>

<p>
'Why mock my earnestness?' asked
Dalton, in a pointed tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
'Because you cannot love me as I would
wish to be loved.'
</p>

<p>
'You do not know me, Mrs. Trelawney.'
</p>

<p>
'I know you better than you know yourself!'
she exclaimed, looking him full in
the face with a peculiar expression that
puzzled him, while her smiles vanished.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps you do,' said he, 'but I think
that, if you once loved a man, that love
would end only with your life.'
</p>

<p>
She regarded him for a moment with an
almost disdainful smile, and said,
</p>

<p>
'And you, Captain Dalton&mdash;if you loved
a woman, how long would your love last?
Only while it suited your fancy or convenience.'
</p>

<p>
'You are very severe with me,' he observed,
with some surprise at her taunting
manner.
</p>

<p>
'Not more than you know you deserve.'
</p>

<p>
At these words Dalton visibly changed
colour, and became confused.  To what
secret of his past life was she referring,
he thought; to what long-buried thoughts
was she finding a clue?
</p>

<p>
'You have become very silent,' said she.
</p>

<p>
He sighed deeply, and rose as if to
depart.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, if my words pain you,
Captain Dalton,' said she, all her spirit
of raillery gone; 'but you have grown
pale, as if the shadow of death were on you.'
</p>

<p>
'It is not that,' said he, with a sickly smile.
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'The shadow of a life rather.'
</p>

<p>
'Whose?' she asked, lightly touching his hand.
</p>

<p>
'My own!'
</p>

<p>
'He <i>has</i> a secret that shall one day be
mine!' thought Mrs. Trelawney, while at
the same moment Dalton was thinking of
the rumour mentioned by Jerry Wilmot,
and marvelled if her occasional peculiarity
of manner arose from that rumour being
founded on truth!
</p>

<p>
But Dalton felt his heart too much
involved, and himself too deeply committed
to let the matter end here.
</p>

<p>
'Your treatment of me is most strange,
Mrs. Trelawney, even cruel, I think,
Laura&mdash;permit me to call you so&mdash;even for once,'
he said.  'My society has always seemed
to give you pleasure, and you have always
seemed glad when I caressed your little
daughter and gave her little presents; and,
truth to tell, dearest Laura, my heart has
somehow gone out to that child as if she
were my own.'
</p>

<p>
'Your own&mdash;yours!' exclaimed Mrs. Trelawney,
as she pressed a hand upon her
heart, and lowered her eyelids, as if to
hide the expression of joy, exultation, and,
odd to say, irritation that mingled in her
face.
</p>

<p>
He trembled violently, as if struggling
with his love of her, and something mental
seemed for a minute to load or fetter his
tongue till he said, in a low voice,
</p>

<p>
'If I can prove that I have the right to
ask you, will you marry me&mdash;will you be
my wife, Laura?'
</p>

<p>
'Do not ask me,' she replied, trembling
in turn.
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;why?' he asked, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Are you aware how strangely you
prelude your proposal by referring to some
eventuality, Captain Dalton?' said she, with
some hauteur; 'but be assured that I can
never be more to you than I am now, were
I to live a hundred years.'
</p>

<p>
'And so you are but a cruel coquette
after all,' said Dalton, recovering himself;
'one who has fooled me&mdash;a man of the
world, as I deemed myself&mdash;to the top
of my bent, only to throw me over at
last.  Well, perhaps I am rightly served,'
he added, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'You <i>are</i> rightly served, Captain Dalton,'
said she, laughing once more.
</p>

<p>
'What do you know&mdash;what do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'What your own heart tells you; but
here is a visitor, Bella Chevenix; let us at
least part friends.'
</p>

<p>
'Mere friends we can never be,' said he,
sadly.
</p>

<p>
'As you please, Captain Dalton; but be
assured we have not seen the last of each
other yet,' she replied, with one of her most
brilliant and coquettish smiles, as he bowed
himself out; and so ended an interview
which both felt had included the most singular
bit of love-making they had ever been
involved in.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, she is an enigma,' muttered
Dalton; but she had no such thought of <i>him</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
'SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!'
</h3>

<p>
'Captain Goring, let it be distinctly
understood that from this day forward
your visits to Chilcote cease, and let
all this be forgotten,' were the words with
which Sir Ranald accosted Goring one
forenoon.
</p>

<p>
'Forgotten!' exclaimed the latter, rising
from his seat, hat in hand.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald had suddenly come in and
found him seated with Alison, paying one
of his usual visits, as Goring wished them to
be thought, and the old man was greatly
ruffled, even exasperated.
</p>

<p>
'As for my daughter, sir, I forbid her to
speak to you again, to recognise you anywhere,
to mention your name, or even think
of you!' he continued, with increasing
vehemence, lashing himself to fresh anger with
the sound of his own words.  'D&mdash;n it, sir,
in my younger days the pistol would have
put an effectual stop to your uncalled-for
interloping.'
</p>

<p>
'Or yours, and your coldness of heart,'
replied Goring, who was so confounded by
this sudden outburst of wrath as scarcely to
know what he said.
</p>

<p>
He was naturally a proud-spirited young
fellow, and rather prompt to ire.  He
blushed scarlet to the temples at these most
affronting speeches; but they gave him
double pain when he saw the wan, blanched,
and imploring face of poor Alison, whose
heart was wrung by the words and bearing
of her father&mdash;a bearing all so unlike his
own usually cold, stately, and aristocratic
self.
</p>

<p>
At that moment she felt a sort of sickening
conviction that all was over between
her and Bevil, as if she was being torn from
him for ever; and, indeed, separation now
was nearer than either of them suspected,
for cruel events were fated to follow each
other fast.
</p>

<p>
Goring bowed to father and daughter,
just touching the hand of the latter as he
withdrew.  Sir Ranald turned his back upon
him and looked through a window; thus
Alison had an opportunity to whisper, 'The
beeches at eight this evening,' and Bevil
left Chilcote with his heart swelling with
anger, and smarting under a keen sense of
insult and regret.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, can you forget that he saw
Ellon laid in his grave?' she was on the
point of saying, while choked with tears,
when she suddenly remembered that Ellon's
ring was now on Goring's finger, and that
the latter's engagement ring was on the
third finger of her left hand, where her
father, in his abstraction, selfishness, and
pre-occupation with monetary affairs, had
never even once detected it.
</p>

<p>
And now, truth to tell, though desperate
with poverty, the struggle to keep up
appearances, and anger to find his purposes
crossed, the old man blushed for himself in
having so far forgot what was due to a
visitor, a guest, and one gentleman to another,
but that emotion was not unmixed with one
of satisfaction that 'the affair,' as he thought
it, 'between Alison and that fellow was over
now and for ever.'
</p>

<p>
On this day Alison could not dissemble;
she cared not to hide her emotion from him,
and let the tears of shame and sorrow pour
hotly and bitterly down her cheeks, while
he looked grimly on, thinking it would 'be
all right by-and-by.'
</p>

<p>
If she were to see Bevil no more, was the
girl's constant thought&mdash;what would become
of her?
</p>

<p>
The hours in which he had no part lagged
fearfully with Alison, and to Bevil, when
they met, the minutes seemed to be literally
winged.  Her whole life had lately been
divided into two portions, one when she
was briefly with Bevil, and the other when
she was <i>not</i>.  Their meetings had become
necessary, as it would seem, to their very
existence, and, were these ended, both
would find their 'occupation gone.'
</p>

<p>
They knew not how they got through
their days before they loved each other, and
had those delicious stolen meetings to look
forward to and look back to, as something
sweet, new, and beloved, to con and dream
over.
</p>

<p>
Till the advent of Bevil Goring, how
drearily dull her life seemed to have been at
Chilcote!  It was all very well to cull and
arrange bouquets with all an artist's eye to
colour and form, to warble the old songs
her mother had taught in brighter days at
Essilmont and elsewhere, with all that
sweetness which she inherited from her,
and vary these occupations by
attendance on her fowls and other pets, hunting
with old Archie for the eggs when the hens
had taken to laying under the hedges;
turning dresses, cleaning her own gloves, and,
while longing for the purse of Fortunatus,
striving to make sixpence go as far as a
shilling, feeling that darning and mending were
her purgatory, and economy the bane of
her existence; but into that existence, with
the love of Bevil Goring, there had come a
ray of brightest sunshine, with a new and
hitherto unknown sense of happiness.  But,
alas! it would seem they were now to be
followed by sorrow, and the gloom of a
hopeless night which would have no end.
</p>

<p>
As the afternoon and evening stole on,
Alison's heart beat wildly and anxiously for
the time of her meeting&mdash;too probably
the last one&mdash;with Bevil, and after a frugal
dinner of cold mutton and boiled rice (a
menu at which her father made more than
one grimace), with old Archie Auchindoir
in attendance, solemnly and respectfully, as
if it had been some banquet suited to
Lucullus, when Sir Ranald began to doze over
his bottle of carefully-aired St. Peray
'Hermitage'&mdash;most probably the last he
possessed&mdash;Alison rose softly from the table
and stole into the entrance hall, where the
hands on the clock dial indicated that the
hour was nearly eight.
</p>

<p>
She assumed the hat and shawl she usually
wore when in the garden, and passing
though the latter, in her resolution to meet
Bevil, almost heedless if her father missed
her, she was about to open the gate that led
to the beech avenue, when she was
startled&mdash;rooted to the spot for a moment&mdash;by
seeing, or fancying she saw, before her, amid
the dark and uncertain shadows of the
November evening, the blacker outline of a
dog&mdash;of a hound before her.
</p>

<p>
At this conviction a gasping cry escaped
her, and a sense of suffocation came into her
slender throat; inspired by a courage
beyond what she deemed she possessed, she
darted forward, but the outline seemed to
melt away before her or elude her eyes.
No dog was there, nor could there have
been, for no dog of mortal mould could
have cleared that lofty wall, and no sound
followed the disappearance.
</p>

<p>
All was still save the drip of the dew as
it fell from the overladen leaf of an evergreen.
</p>

<p>
Alison felt her heart beating painfully,
while a deadly chill seemed to settle upon
it.  Had the family boding of evil been
before her?  Oh, no, no&mdash;impossible.  And
yet it was said that when Ellon and her
mother died&mdash;&mdash;  She tried to thrust the
thought away.
</p>

<p>
It must have been, she said to herself,
some peculiar arrangement of light and
shadow&mdash;some shadow formed in the starlight
and thrown on the grass; for often as
she heard of that Dog of Doom&mdash;the Spectre
Hound of Essilmont&mdash;she always shrank
from believing in its existence, but her heart
was filled with vague and undefinable
apprehension nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
There was a step on the gravel, a figure
appeared in the shade of the star-lighted
avenue, and in another moment she was
sobbing heavily in Bevil's arms.
</p>

<p>
Her excessive agitation he attributed,
naturally, to the very unpleasant scene of
the forenoon, especially when she said,
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  Bevil, how, or in what terms, am I
to apologise to you for the mode in which
papa treated you to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'Poor old gentleman, I can pardon all
his petulance, but it fills me with a fear that
he designs you to be the wife of another.
Curse upon this poverty of mine, which
mars as yet the life of us both, Alison.  I
have done wrong in loving you and winning
you without your father's permission;
but he never would have accorded it.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' moaned Alison, with her cheek on
his breast; 'something is about to
happen&mdash;something terrible about to befall us!'
</p>

<p>
'Something, darling&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'Death, or a calamity little short of it,
perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you,' said Bevil,
caressing her with great tenderness, and
becoming very anxious on finding how faint
her voice was, and how excessively she was
trembling.  'Dearest Alison, the night air
is chill, I am selfish and barbarous in
keeping you here.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't say so, my love,' murmured the
girl, as she nestled close to him, 'for
something is about to happen, and heaven knows
only when I may meet you again.'
</p>

<p>
'What fills you so with apprehension?'
</p>

<p>
And now, with pale and trembling lips,
while reclining in Goring's arms, she told
him the family legend, at which he&mdash;a man
of the period&mdash;a young officer within a mile
or so of his lines at Aldershot, felt inclined
to laugh very heartily, but for Alison's
intense dejection, and the doubts and fears
incident to their mutual position.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Alison,' said he, smiling, 'you
have one <i>bête noire</i> assuredly&mdash;old Cadbury&mdash;don't,
for heaven's sake, manufacture and
adopt another.'
</p>

<p>
'Bevil, don't jest with me,' she said,
imploringly.
</p>

<p>
'I do not jest with you, sweet one; but
tell me all about this devilish hound&mdash;for
such it must be, of course.'
</p>

<p>
It would seem that it first appeared on
the night of a dreadful storm, centuries
ago&mdash;a night when the wind howled and
roared round Essilmont, and the Ythan,
white and foaming, tore in full flood through
the dreary heather glens towards the sea,
and when the thunder peals seemed to rend
heaven; yet amid all this elemental din the
gate-ward at Essilmont heard the baying of
a dog at the gate, and, opening it, a large
black hound came in, and was permitted to
crouch by the hall fire, and when the
embers of the latter began to sink and fade
away, it was remarked by those who were
there that the eyes of the great shaggy
hound, as it lay with its long sharp nose
resting on its outstretched paws, had in
them a strangely diabolical and malicious
glitter as they roved from face to face.
</p>

<p>
'I dislike the aspect of this brute,' said
the Laird to the Lady of Essilmont, and as
he spoke the hound began to lash the floor
with his tail.  'Let him be driven forth.'
</p>

<p>
'I pray you not,' said she.  'The poor
animal may have lost its master.'
</p>

<p>
On this the hound, as if grateful to her,
licked her white hand with his red tongue,
and she stroked him tenderly.  She was
Annot Udney, a daughter of the Laird of
Auchterellon, and reputed as a witch, and
the possessor of a remarkable magic crystal
ball, with which she could work good or
evil, but the latter most frequently.
</p>

<p>
'Annot, its aspect chills me,' said the
laird again.
</p>

<p>
'Chills you, Ranald?' exclaimed the lady.
'You whose spear was foremost in the fray
last week at the Red Harlaw.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;I shudder, and know not why,' he
replied, and signed himself with the cross,
on which the hound instantly snarled, and
showed all his white glistening teeth, while
his eyes glared like red and fiery carbuncles.
</p>

<p>
No more was wanting now to prove to
Ranald Cheyne that the animal was a thing
of evil, so snatching up a halbert he was
about to cleave his head when the lady
interposed with outstretched arms and a cry
of dismay.  She was a woman of rare
beauty and great sweetness of manner,
notwithstanding her evil repute; so she stayed
her husband's arm, and said,
</p>

<p>
'Let me put forth the hound.'
</p>

<p>
'You, Annot?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;I,' she replied; and patting the
dog's rough head it rose and followed her
to the outer gate, and now the wild storm
which shook the walls some time before was
over; it seemed to have spent its fury and
passed away.
</p>

<p>
A little time elapsed; Annot Cheyne did
not return: the laird became anxious and
impatient, and as all the household were
now abed he followed her.
</p>

<p>
The sky was cloudless now, and the white
moonlight fell aslant in silvery sheets over
the barbican wall, and in the flood of it
that streamed through the outer archway
he saw his wife caressing the gigantic hound.
</p>

<p>
'Annot!' cried he, impatiently.  She
made no answer, but stooped and again
caressed the dog.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a dark cloud passed
suddenly and quickly over the face of the
moon, involving the archway in blackness
and obscurity; and the baying of the hound
was heard, but, as it seemed, at a vast
distance.
</p>

<p>
When, a minute after, the moon emerged
from its shadow, the radiance streamed
through the archway as before; but
there was no one visible&mdash;the lady and the
hound had disappeared!
</p>

<p>
'She was never seen again,' said Alison
in conclusion; 'but as for the hound, that
came and went with the tempest, it has
appeared, or has been said to have done so,
when&mdash;when evil was near the Cheynes of
Essilmont; and, whether the story of its
appearance was fable or fancy, the evil
certainly came in some fashion or other.'
</p>

<p>
'It is the offspring of vulgar superstition
or fevered fancy.  How can you think of
old-world Scotch nonsense in this age,
Alison?' said Bevil Goring.
</p>

<p>
'If a boding of evil it is, I hope it
menaces me, and not poor papa,' said Alison,
down whose cheeks the unseen tears were
streaming in the dark, 'and as for Lord
Cadbury&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Don't speak about him&mdash;don't think
about him!' interrupted Bevil, impatiently.
'And yet,' he added, 'if this old fellow
loves you, I do not wonder at it.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because all men who know you must
love you, though I hope it is to be your
destiny, your strength, to love but one.
Yet, Alison, what agony it must be to love
you as I do, and only to lose you after all.'
</p>

<p>
This unfortunate speech, though meant to
be a loving compliment by Goring, seemed
but the echo of the forebodings that were in
the heart of Alison, and she wept heavily
while he strained her to his breast and
kissed her, not once but many times, and she
hung or lay passive in his embrace like a
dead weight, while the hearts of both were
full of a kind of passionate despair&mdash;their
future seemed so much without hope&mdash;their
present menaced by so much turmoil and
opposition.
</p>

<p>
'My darling, my darling,' exclaimed Goring,
when at last he released her, 'whatever
happens I shall never, never give you up.'
</p>

<p>
So they parted at last, to meet at their
trysting place on the second day ensuing, and
Alison, as she hurried homeward, and passed
amid the dark shadows of the star-lighted
garden, looked fearfully round her with
dilated eyes, while her spirit quailed in
dread of seeing defined through the gloom
what she saw, or thought she saw, before,
and hastened into the house, closing the
door softly, yet swiftly behind her, as if
pursued by something unseen.
</p>

<p>
Duty detained Goring at the camp during
the intervening day, but on the following,
full of more lover-like anxiety than ever,
with a hundred things to say, to ask, and
to hear, hopes to suggest, and comforting
speeches to make, he sought the beeches,
and waited there till all hope died out.
</p>

<p>
Alison did not come; the day was cold;
the wind bleak and keen as the very last
of the damp brown leaves were swept away
with it, and at last he turned aside with a
heavy heart.
</p>

<p>
The next day and the next brought the
same result.  She failed to meet him, and
dismay filled his heart lest she might be
ill.  She was delicate and fragile, and the
last night they met she was terribly shaken
and excited by the untoward episode of
the morning and her superstitious terror
of the evening.
</p>

<p>
From the moment Bevil Goring met and
knew Alison Cheyne, his heart had gone
out of his own keeping, and never returned
to it again.  His love for her had become
deep and intense, but, strange to say, did not
seem a hopeful one, unless fortune changed
suddenly with him.  It was useless to
expect it would do so with her family now.
</p>

<p>
His position was good; his family name
unimpeachable.  He bore a high reputation
in his regiment as a brave and well-trained
officer, and one well used to command;
but his means were certainly not what he
should ask a wife of Alison's culture to
share, nor in any way were they equal to the
ambition and dire necessities of the
bankrupt baronet of Essilmont.
</p>

<p>
After some more days of agonising delay
and anxiety, Goring resolved to proceed to
Chilcote House, and endeavour to discover
if aught ailed Alison, or how it was that
she had ceased to come to their meeting-place
as usual.
</p>

<p>
From the clustered and ivy-clad chimneys
no smoke ascended against the grey
November sky.  Every window was shuttered
and closed.  There was an absence
of all stir&mdash;an oppressive silence everywhere
in and around the house&mdash;even from the
little court where the clucking of Alison's
hens was wont to be heard.  A spade yet
remained stuck in a plot of the garden, as
if old silver-haired Archie Auchindoir had
suddenly quitted his work there and
returned no more.
</p>

<p>
Either by the result of mischief, or recent
neglect, a large mass of the ivy and clematis
that overhung the pretty little oaken porch
had fallen down, and, if further evidence
of total desertion were necessary, a large
white ticket on a pole announced in black
letters that the 'commodious villa of
Chilcote was to let, furnished or unfurnished.
Communications to be made in writing to
Mr. Solomon Slagg, St. Clement's Lane,
City.'
</p>

<p>
On taking in all these details of a sudden,
hasty, and perhaps disastrous departure, the
heart of Bevil seemed to stand still for
some seconds.
</p>

<p>
Where had the little household gone, and
why?  And why did not Alison write to
him of her movements? though he could
not have replied without compromising her.
Was Sir Ranald dead?  Was she?  Oh,
no! no!  He must have heard it&mdash;friends
in camp must have heard through the public
prints of any catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
She was gone&mdash;carried off; he could not
doubt it&mdash;but whither and to what end he
could not even surmise; his bower of
roses&mdash;his fool's paradise, was levelled in the
dust at last, and he could but linger, and
look hopelessly and questioningly at the
ticket of Mr. Solomon Slagg, and at the
darkened windows through which Alison
must often have looked, perhaps watching
for his own approach.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to Mr. Slagg for information
and Sir Ranald's address, but received no
answer (doubtless Mr. Slagg was acting
under the orders of Lord Cadbury), save
printed circulars, from which it appeared
that Mr. Slagg was ready to advance
'money confidentially to young officers
and others on easy terms, borrowers' own
security, repayments at convenience, &amp;c., &amp;c.'
</p>

<p>
It was terrible for Bevil Goring to
surrender those hopes he had been cherishing
in the depths of his heart&mdash;hopes that,
though of recent growth, were strong, and
dear, and precious, and the realisation of
which had become his daily prayer.
</p>

<p>
A darkness as sudden seemed to have
fallen upon him!
</p>

<p>
He remembered now all the poor girl's
painful forebodings on that last eventful
night that <i>something was about to happen</i>&mdash;the
surely absurd story about the spectre
dog, which he had so affectionately derided;
but now 'something' certainly <i>had</i> come to
pass!  And what was it?

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
EVIL TIDINGS.
</h3>

<p>
'I'm glad to see you back, Miss Cheyne,'
said Archie, as she met him in the
passage or entrance-hall; 'Sir Ranald has
missed you sairly.'
</p>

<p>
'Missed me?  I left him asleep, Archie,'
exclaimed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Something wakened him wi' a start, just
as ye gaed into the garden.'
</p>

<p>
'Something&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'A sound, I watna what,' replied Archie,
unwillingly, smoothing his silver hair with
his hand, and looking round him stealthily.
</p>

<p>
'What sound?  I heard nothing in the garden.'
</p>

<p>
'Weel, something like the baying o' a hound.'
</p>

<p>
'A <i>hound</i>!' said Alison, faintly.
</p>

<p>
'I dinna quite say sae; but say naething to
Sir Ranald aboot it.  Gang to him at aince;
he's got some unco news, I fear, by the
evening post.'
</p>

<p>
Walking like an automaton, though very
pale, and tremulous in heart and limb,
Alison entered the dining-room, where she
found her father walking up and down its
entire length, with a letter crushed and
crumpled in his thin white hand, which was
nervously clenched upon it.  His face was
very pale; his lips were twitching, and
drops of perspiration stood upon his brow.
</p>

<p>
'Papa!' exclaimed Alison, winding her
soft arms round him; 'what is the matter
with you?'
</p>

<p>
'It has come at last, child.'
</p>

<p>
'What has come?'
</p>

<p>
'The long-impending and utter ruin,
unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'You will save me; end my sorrows, and
your own, by accepting Cadbury.  You can
lift from my heart and our family the
shadow that has darkened them so long&mdash;the
cold shadow of grinding poverty.'
</p>

<p>
Her lips became white and parched&mdash;so
parched that she had to moisten them with
her tongue, and even then she could not
speak for a time.  Bevil Goring's kisses
were fresh upon them, and now she had to
listen to a death sentence like this!
</p>

<p>
Her first dread had been a reference to
her absence at such a time, but, by the
business in question, it was evident her
ramble in the dusk was forgotten, or a very
subordinate matter indeed.
</p>

<p>
'A man named Slagg has written me,'
said Sir Ranald, in a low and faint voice,
while leaning with one hand on the table
and the other pressed on the region of the
heart, 'written me to the effect that all my
recent and too often renewed acceptances
and promissory notes have come&mdash;how, I
know not&mdash;into his possession, and that if I
do not liquidate them forthwith everything
we have&mdash;even to the chairs we sit on&mdash;will
be seized, and myself too probably
arrested, while you, Alison&mdash;you, my loved
Ailie,' he continued, with sudden pathos in
his voice&mdash;'will have neither house nor
home!'
</p>

<p>
He was a proud man, Sir Ranald Cheyne,
and apart from the selfishness peculiar to
many of his class&mdash;especially in Scotland&mdash;an
honourable man.  Thus it is but fair to
infer that had he known or been aware in
the least degree of the game Lord Cadbury
was playing, and that the letter of Solomon
Slagg was his trump card, he would rather
have faced ruin and beggary than urged this
odious marriage on his daughter.
</p>

<p>
The latter clasped her hands in silence
and looked and felt like a hunted creature.
Prior to this she had often thought over the
means of escape, of working for her bread&mdash;a
mode of work of which she had very
vague ideas indeed&mdash;but now she felt stunned
and stupefied.
</p>

<p>
After all&mdash;after the dawn and noon of
the sweet day that had stolen upon her&mdash;could
she do nothing, if she was to serve
her father, but to marry this vulgar lord?
</p>

<p>
'I have refused Lord Cadbury's written
proposal, papa,' said she, in a voice so low
that it sounded like a whisper.
</p>

<p>
'He will renew it, and it is a brilliant
offer, Alison.  He will be kind to you&mdash;so
kind, Alison&mdash;and you&mdash;you will not be so
mad as to refuse him now.  Think of his
proffered settlements and of what we&mdash;what
I owe him.'
</p>

<p>
'Think of every one, of all&mdash;all but myself
and my future!' said Alison, with her
slender fingers interlaced above her head
and her eyes cast despairingly upward.
</p>

<p>
'She is yielding,' thought Sir Ranald;
'but I see how it is&mdash;this fellow Goring is
in our way.'
</p>

<p>
Then he put his arm round her caressingly and said,
</p>

<p>
'The sooner you become sensible, Alison,
and forget your foolish&mdash;your most unwise
fancy for that young fellow at Aldershot,
the better for yourself and for&mdash;me.'
</p>

<p>
He never forgot <i>himself</i> with all his love
for his daughter.
</p>

<p>
'But, papa,' she said, with pallid lips, 'I
love&mdash;Bevil.'
</p>

<p>
'It has come to this&mdash;an engagement?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, papa, I cannot deceive you.'
</p>

<p>
'An engagement&mdash;a secret one&mdash;without
my knowledge; how dared you?'
</p>

<p>
'I promised to wait for a year&mdash;he asked
me only a year&mdash;and he loves me so much!'
</p>

<p>
'No doubt,' snarled Sir Ranald, through
his set teeth.  'People cannot live on love,
however, and your friend "Bevil," as you
call him, cannot pay my debts.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, would that he could do so!'
</p>

<p>
'Till recently you have always been
accustomed to luxury and ease.  These
Cadbury lays at your feet, offering you&mdash;who
by position and education are unfit to be a
poor man's wife&mdash;absolute splendour.'
</p>

<p>
'But Bevil is not so poor as you think,
and, moreover, may be richer in time,' urged
Alison, piteously; 'he has prospects,
expectations&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;what sharper is without
them?&mdash;and for the realization of these
visions you would be waiting to the sacrifice
of your youth, your beauty, and your
poor old father's few remaining years.'
</p>

<p>
She wrung her white hands.  She had
often thought before of the tradesmen's
unpaid bills&mdash;of her dresses made to do duty
for a second season she had never thought
at all; but now the letter of Slagg had
filled her with vague and undefinable
terror.
</p>

<p>
She could not, poor girl, understand the
tenor of it altogether, but she knew it meant
ruin, for she could read that in her father's
anxious face; yet why should fate compel
her to marry Lord Cadbury?&mdash;she could
work&mdash;work or die!
</p>

<p>
'Loving Bevil as I do, papa, it would be
very base of me to accept Lord Cadbury
without even an atom of respect or gratitude,'
said she, gathering courage from her
very despair, while her eyes streamed with
tears.
</p>

<p>
'I do not see that love has much to do
with marriage, but know that money has a
great deal,' said her father, smoothing out
the letter of Solomon Slagg for re-perusal.
'Love is a luxury the poor can't afford,
and it is better to marry on a little of it,
and find that little increase by residence
together and force of habit, than marry on
much, and find that much dwindling away
into mutual toleration and cold indifference.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald had not an atom of sympathy
with or toleration for this love fancy, so he
deemed it, of his daughter.  His own lover-days
and his marriage seemed to have come
to pass so long ago as to have belonged to
some state of pre-existence.  He could
scarcely realise them now; yet he knew
they must have been; Burke and Debrett
told him so; and Alison was there as a
living proof of both; but his love&mdash;if love it
was&mdash;had been a well-ordered arrangement
with a lady of good position and ample
means, not with an obscure nobody.
</p>

<p>
'Papa,' said Alison, after a silence that
had been broken only by her sighs and his
own, 'when urging me to do what you
wish, have you no thought of the long line
of the Cheynes of Essilmont, who lived there
for so many centuries&mdash;who so often lost
their lives in battle, but never honour, who
never stained their name by any base or
ignoble transaction, who lived and died so
spotlessly?'
</p>

<p>
This little outburst was something precisely
after his own heart; he patted Alison's
head of rich brown hair, and said,
with a kindling in his eyes,
</p>

<p>
'It is precisely because I do think of them
that I wish to see you wealthy and ennobled,
raised out of this now sordid life of
ours.'
</p>

<p>
'Ennobled by wedding the son of Timothy
Titcomb, of Threadneedle Street!'
</p>

<p>
'If you will not save me by doing so, we
have nothing left for it now but a disgraceful
flight.'
</p>

<p>
'Flight?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; I must quit this place ere I am arrested.'
</p>

<p>
'For where?'
</p>

<p>
'God alone knows.'
</p>

<p>
Alison interlaced her fingers again in
mute misery.
</p>

<p>
'You look worn and weary, Alison,' said
Sir Ranald, observing the pinched expression
of her little white face.
</p>

<p>
'I am both, indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Then go to bed, child; think over all I
have urged, think of what is before us,
think well, and give me a final answer in
the morning.'
</p>

<p>
She kissed him with lips that were cold
and quivering, and retired to her room,
while he threw open his bureau, drew the
lamp towards him, spread a sheet of paper
with a vague idea that he was about to
make some monetary calculations, and
mechanically dipped a pen in the ink-bottle.
</p>

<p>
Then he threw it down, and, resting his
aching head upon his delicate and wrinkled
hands, sank into a kind of stupor of thought.
</p>

<p>
From this he was roused by a hand being
laid gently on his shoulder, and by the
voice of old Archie Auchindoir saying,
while he shook his white head,
</p>

<p>
'Puir Sir Ranald&mdash;oh! my dear maister;
eild and poortith are sair burdens for ae
back.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you want, Archie?' he asked, peevishly.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Ranald, sir, I've a sma' matter o'
three hunder pound and mair saved up in
your service, and at your service it is now,
every bodle o'd&mdash;tak' it and welcome; it
may help ye at this pinch&mdash;tak' it, for God's
sake, if it will tak' the tears frae Miss
Alison's een.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Archie, I thank you,' said Sir
Ranald, shaking the hand of this faithful
old man, whose eyes were inflamed with the
tears he was, perhaps, too aged to shed; 'it
is very generous of you, this offer, but
is&mdash;pardon me saying so&mdash;simply absurd!'
</p>

<p>
Again and again Archie pressed the little
man in vain upon the acceptance of his
master, till the pride of the latter
turned his gratitude into something of his
usual hauteur, on which Archie withdrew
sorrowfully, muttering under his
breath,
</p>

<p>
'Troth, he's weel boden there ben, that
will neither borrow nor lend.'
</p>

<p>
Meaning that Sir Ranald must surely be
well enough off, if he could afford to
dispense with all assistance.
</p>

<p>
With her gorgeous brown hair unrolled
and floating over her shoulders, Alison,
with her hands lying listlessly in her lap, sat
lost in her own terrible thoughts, with her
tear-inflamed eyes gazing into her bed-room
fire, which had just attained that clear, red
light, without flickering flame, in which one
may fancy strange scenes without end&mdash;deep
valleys, caverns, rocks, castles perched on
cliffs, faces, and profiles; and therein had
she seen, more than once, Essilmont with its
Scoto-French turrets with their conical roofs
and vanes, its crow-stepped gables and
massive chimneys, that she now might never
see in reality again!
</p>

<p>
A victim on the double altar of gold and
filial piety.
</p>

<p>
How often had she read in novels and
romances, and how often had she seen on
the stage, the story of a heroine&mdash;a wretched
girl placed in precisely the cruel predicament
in which she now found herself, and
deemed that such dramatic and doleful
situations could only exist in the fancies of
the author or of the playwright!
</p>

<p>
Without, the cold and wintry wind had
torn away the last leaves from every tree
long since; the last flowers were also long
dead; the chill night rain pattered, with
sleet and hail, upon the windows; and, like
the heart of Alison, all nature seemed
desolate and sad.
</p>

<p>
She shuddered when she heard the
moaning of the wind, and thought of the
Spectre Hound.
</p>

<p>
Could it be that she had indeed seen it?

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
CADBURY'S PLAN OR PLOT.
</h3>

<p>
And now to relate what more came to
pass at Chilcote, and where Alison
had vanished to.
</p>

<p>
The morning came to her after a sleepless
night, and she was incapable of giving the
answer to which Sir Ranald had hopefully
looked forward.  She was in a species of
mental fever.  So passed the day&mdash;the day
she knew that she could not meet Bevil&mdash;and
the short winter evening was passing
into another night, when the ringing of the
door bell gave her a kind of electric shock,
so thoroughly was her whole nervous
system shaken.
</p>

<p>
The hour was a dark and gloomy one;
snow flakes were falling athwart the dreary
landscape of leafless trees, and the north
wind moaned sadly round old Chilcote and
its giant beeches, with a wail that seemed
consonant with disasters impending there,
when Lord Cadbury arrived, by chance as
it seemed, but in reality to see the effect
of the bomb he had fired from the office
of Mr. Solomon Slagg, in St. Clement's
Lane.
</p>

<p>
The curtains had been drawn over the
windows by the tiny little hands of Daisy
Prune; a coal fire blazed pleasantly in the
grate, and threw a ruddy glow over all the
panelled room and the family portraits,
particularly on those of the two Cavalier
brothers, looking so proud and defiant in
their gorgeous costume, that ere long would
be finding their way to the brokers in
Wardour Street or elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald and Alison sat alone&mdash;alone
in their misery&mdash;when the peer came
jauntily in, and took in the whole situation
at a glance&mdash;the poor girl, with all her rare
beauty, looking utterly disconsolate; the
bankrupt father, with all his pride, looking
utterly desperate!
</p>

<p>
Alison was seated, or rather crouching,
on a black bearskin rug by Sir Ranald's
side&mdash;one arm caressingly thrown over his
knees, and she was in the act of touching
his wrinkled hand with hers with a fondness
pretty to see, and then he stooped to take
her face between them both and looked into
her blue-grey eyes wistfully.
</p>

<p>
They formed a lovely picture, but it
touched not the heart of my Lord Cadbury
of Cadbury Court.
</p>

<p>
The bezique cards lay on the table
close by, where old Archie had placed
them as usual; but they were unnoticed
now.  Father and daughter were quite past
playing their quiet game together.
</p>

<p>
Alison, as if the visitor's presence was to
her insupportable, arose, and muttering some
excuse, she knew not what, withdrew to
her own room.
</p>

<p>
In Sir Ranald's eyes there was a passionate
and despairing expression of pain that
wrung the very soul of Alison; but still, she
thought, why should the love of her youth,
and why should <i>her</i> whole future life be
sacrificed for one who had enjoyed his long
life to the full, and all because her
grandfather had been, like her father, a spendthrift!
</p>

<p>
Cadbury took in the whole situation; all
that he anticipated had come to pass;
the result was exactly what he had foreseen,
and he now hoped that he would be
able to triumph over Alison, whose repugnance
for him piqued his pride and excited
his revenge.
</p>

<p>
'What is the matter, Cheyne&mdash;you look
seriously unwell?' said he, with well-feigned
interest.
</p>

<p>
'You find me a sorely broken man,' replied
Sir Ranald, in a hollow voice, as he
took the hand of his visitor and begged
him to be seated.  'Ruin has overtaken me
at last, Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'I think I can guess,' said the latter, tugging
at his long white moustaches; 'but tell
me in what form.'
</p>

<p>
In a few words, but with intense shame
and mortification of spirit, Sir Ranald told of
Slagg's threatening letter, and of all that his
listener had been aware of days before.
</p>

<p>
'And these acceptances must be met?'
</p>

<p>
'But how, Cadbury&mdash;how?  I might as
well attempt to make a river run up a hill.'
</p>

<p>
'What is before you?' asked the peer, a
cunning smile twinkling in his eyes, unseen
by his visitor.
</p>

<p>
'Death or disgrace!'
</p>

<p>
'Disgrace in what fashion?'
</p>

<p>
'Arrest or flight.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury continued to pull each of his
moustaches in a kind of nervous way, and
after a minute's silence he said, with a
kind of laugh,
</p>

<p>
'I think I can help you.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not a man who has been used to
seek help from others,' said Sir Ranald,
with a little of his old pride of bearing.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury coughed and smiled as he
thought of more than one cheque given to
the speaker, and by the latter apparently
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
'Under this terrible pressure, have you
spoken of my proposal to&mdash;to Miss Cheyne?'
he asked, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And with what result&mdash;for she knows
what I can do, if I choose?'
</p>

<p>
'None&mdash;none!'
</p>

<p>
'Even to save you, she will not marry me?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'No!'
</p>

<p>
'At least, I have totally failed to extract
an answer from her.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury's ferret-like eyes flashed;
he actually ground his teeth and clenched
his coarse, vulgar hands.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Cheyne&mdash;if I take up your
paper and pay Slagg, could you not force
her&mdash;I say, force&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hush&mdash;she might fall ill and die, as her
mother died, of a decline,' groaned Sir
Ranald.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! not a bit, not a bit,' said Cadbury;
'but change of air will do her good.  Let
us get her out of this place, anyway.'
</p>

<p>
'The fact is, she has a fancy for that
infantry fellow, Bevil Goring, at Aldershot,'
said Sir Ranald, who carefully omitted to
state that Alison had admitted her engagement.
</p>

<p>
'The devil&mdash;but I don't need to be told
that,' exclaimed Cadbury, angrily; 'yet we
must eradicate that fancy, and sharply
too.'
</p>

<p>
'But how?'
</p>

<p>
'Take her over to the Continent.  Let
us get her on board my yacht, with you as
her protector, and all will come right in the
end, and I'll leave <i>you</i> ashore somewhere
when you least suspect it,' was Cadbury's
concluding thought.
</p>

<p>
'But these bills that Slagg holds&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Are not in his possession now.'
</p>

<p>
'In whose, then?' asked Sir Ranald, with
fresh alarm.
</p>

<p>
'In mine.'
</p>

<p>
'Yours?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;look here.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury opened his pocket-book and laid
before the startled eyes of Sir Ranald eight
or nine bills and promissory notes, all of
which he knew but too well.
</p>

<p>
'How comes this pass?' he asked, with a
bewildered air, as he passed a hand across
his forehead.
</p>

<p>
'I know Solomon Slagg.  I knew him
to my cost ere I came to the title.  You
mentioned that he had acceptances of yours.
I got them all up, and trust that in quietude
Alison will end this nonsense and become
Lady Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald shook his head and sank back
in his chair.
</p>

<p>
'If I put these papers in the fire, will you
stick to my plan of getting her on board
my yacht, and leaving the rest to time and
to me?' asked Cadbury, in a voice that
intensity rendered husky.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Sir Ranald, in a faint voice,
while eyeing the fatal documents as if they
had serpent-like fascination for him.
</p>

<p>
'Your hand upon it.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald put his cold, thin hand in the
peer's rough and pudgy one, and in another
moment the documents were vanishing in
the fire.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald seemed as one in a dream;
he could scarcely believe his senses, and
that he was thus freed from those
encumbrances, the sudden destruction of which
had not been a part of Cadbury's plan on
the day he visited Slagg, but was an
afterthought to produce a species of dramatic
situation, and win, perhaps, through fear or
gratitude, what Alison would never accord
him from love.
</p>

<p>
He had now, he thought&mdash;for he well
knew his man&mdash;secured the livelong gratitude
and trust of her father; and through
her filial love of the latter, and the peril
which she would still be led to suppose was
menacing him, he would attain the means
of getting her away and controlling her
movements.
</p>

<p>
It is an old aphorism which says with
truth that a man is usually more inclined to
feel kindly towards one on whom he has
conferred favours than to one from whom
he has received them; thus, barely had Sir
Ranald seen the last of his blue paper
shrivel up in the flames, and thus felt a
load lifted off his mind, when his natural
sense of gratitude jarred with his equally
natural constitutional pride, which revolted
at the idea of being favoured or protected
by any man.
</p>

<p>
However, they mutually resolved, after
Sir Ranald had poured forth his expressions
of gratitude, with promises to refund
whenever it was in his power to do so, that
Alison should be kept in ignorance of what
had been done with the bills till they had
her on board the yacht, when they both
hoped to count upon her gratitude; and
now, when the pressure of the present
danger had passed away, Sir Ranald felt more
than ever annoyance, even rage, at his
daughter's folly and obstinacy&mdash;folly in
permitting herself to be swayed by a regard
for Goring, and obstinacy in declining the
proposal of Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
'And now that is arranged,' said the
latter, 'I'll telegraph to Tom Llanyard to
get the <i>Firefly</i> into Southampton Water.
We can take the train at Basingstoke and
be off to-morrow, bag and baggage.
Pension off or pay off that old Scotch fellow,
Auchindoir&mdash;he is not worth his salt, and
would only be in the way on board the
<i>Firefly</i>; ditto with old Prune your
housekeeper.  We'll take Daisy with us, however,
as Alison must have a maid; and, until we
are at sea, watch well that she has no means
of posting letters.'
</p>

<p>
Now that the keen and aching sense of
immediate danger had passed away, or been
replaced by gratitude and thankfulness, Sir
Ranald's spirit, in addition to his annoyance
with Alison, writhed under the part he
found himself compelled to act, in silently
permitting Lord Cadbury to direct his
daughter's movements and to arrange their
household matters.
</p>

<p>
But now the packing and preparations for
departure began that very night, and were
resumed with fresh energy on the following
day, Alison toiling with a will in the
selection of her father's wardrobe and her own.
Alas! there was but little in either to make
the selection difficult, sorrow for the sudden
separation from Goring on one hand being
tempered on the other by a belief that
immediate departure alone could save Sir
Ranald from the peril that menaced him
but yesterday; and so closely was she
watched, and so much were her movements
hampered, that she was totally without an
opportunity for writing or dispatching even
the smallest note to Aldershot.
</p>

<p>
'And sae you're gaun awa', and without
me?' said Archie, rather reproachfully, to
Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; from here, certainly.'
</p>

<p>
'Where to?'
</p>

<p>
'God knows where to,' was the absent
response.
</p>

<p>
'Back to Essilmont, maybe?'
</p>

<p>
'In time, perhaps, Archie; in time, but
not now,' said Sir Ranald, with a bitter
sigh.
</p>

<p>
'Tak' tent, Sir Ranald; for gudesake
gang hooly.  Dinna wade if ye canna see
the bottom,' resumed Archie, in a low and
confidential voice; 'and beware ye o' that
Lord Cadbury.  I ken a spune frae a stot's
horn as weel as maist men, and I distrust
him sairly.'
</p>

<p>
'That I do not.  He has just been a good
friend to me, Archie; and now a word in
your ear&mdash;when I want advice from you
concerning my friends or my affairs, I shall
condescend to ask it.'
</p>

<p>
The old servitor looked abashed and
crushed.  He bowed very low, and
withdrew in silence.
</p>

<p>
At last the hour of departure came, and
Lord Cadbury's carriage and a light luggage-van
were at the door; and, ere Alison was
assisted into the former, she shook old
Archie's hand, and then with a sudden
impulse kissed his cheek, for she had known
Archie from her infancy.  Thus he seemed
to her as a part and parcel of Essilmont;
and, when the carriage rolled away with her
in it, the old man lifted up his hands and
voice and wept as only the aged and the
hopeless weep.
</p>

<p>
'Poor girl!' thought Cadbury, with a
grimace, when after a time there came a
distant view of Aldershot, with its camp of
huts, its church spire, and Twesildown Hill,
'she'll hold, I suppose, for a time, to her
little rag of fidelity&mdash;her promise to that
fellow Goring in the infantry lines; but,
<i>faute de mieux</i>, we shall cure her of that.
We shall see what we shall see, when an
hour on board the <i>Firefly</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Well did Alison know where Aldershot
lay, but, conscious that her tormentor's keen
eyes were upon her, she turned hers away
and gazed steadily in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
'I thought I had bidden good-bye to the
world, Cadbury,' said Sir Ranald, with the
nearest approach to a smile Alison had
seen on his thin, worn face for some time
past; 'and here I am about to see it again
in your yacht.  Alison will require some
additions to her wardrobe, I fear, but we
have no time for that; and though she has
Daisy for her attendant, I should like her
also to have the society of some lady
friend&mdash;do you know of one?'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury looked perplexed.
</p>

<p>
'What need of a lady friend or chaperon
when you, her own father, are with her?
Besides, we are close run for time, and
Llanyard awaits us at Southampton,' he
replied, almost with irritation.
</p>

<p>
'I have been engaged in many little
affairs,' he grumbled in thought, as he
recalled the burned bills and the enormous
cost, 'but never in a "love chase" so
expensive as this!  I am in for it now,
however, and may as well go through with it;
and what will the clubs say when they hear
that I am off to see the Continent with old
Cheyne's pretty daughter?'
</p>

<p>
The veteran lover chuckled in his vanity
at this, and, ideas of marriage apart, he
actually began to scheme how he might
'drop' Sir Ranald somewhere on the
Continent, compromise the girl in some way,
and thus revenge himself on her and Goring
too.
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely made up his mind yet
in what direction to sail at that inclement
season, but, wherever it was, another route
would be announced in the papers, to throw
adventurous lovers off the scent.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
MORE MYSTERY.
</h3>

<p>
Bevil Goring was greatly perplexed
and bewildered by the sudden
disappearance of the household at Chilcote,
and in quest of information rode over to
Mrs. Trelawney at the Grange, and she
expressed herself as much surprised as himself
at their abrupt departure, but she knew
only a little more on the subject than he did.
</p>

<p>
The baronet and his daughter had left
England in Lord Cadbury's yacht the <i>Firefly</i>
several days ago.
</p>

<p>
'Gone! sailed thus suddenly without a
letter of explanation, of farewell, or the
time of her return being even hinted to me,'
were Goring's natural thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'And what about Lord Cadbury?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! he has gone too; the Court is shut
up,' replied Mrs. Trelawney, with a faint
approach to a smile.
</p>

<p>
'Gone too!' replied Goring, more mystified
than ever.
</p>

<p>
Was she yielding to the pressure put
upon her by Sir Ranald&mdash;yielding after all?
</p>

<p>
'And for where has the party sailed?' he
asked.
</p>

<p>
'There is no party, on board, I understand,
but only Lord Cadbury, Alison, and
her father; and whither they have gone no
one knows&mdash;they decamped so hurriedly.
But you, at least, will certainly hear in
time,' said Mrs. Trelawney, with a soft
smile, as she knew well how deep was the
interest Goring and Miss Cheyne had in
each other.
</p>

<p>
'I am indeed surprised that&mdash;that Alison
did not write about the whole affair to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps she did not know in time, or
her letter may not have been&mdash;may have
from some cause miscarried.  So whether
they are seeking the fiords of Norway or
the source of the Nile we cannot know.'
</p>

<p>
'And who was your informant so far,
Mrs. Trelawney?'
</p>

<p>
'Old Mrs. Rebecca Prune, who came with
a farewell message from Alison to me&mdash;a
circumstance which I thought strange, as
courtesy required that she should have
called, or at least written.'
</p>

<p>
'And there was none for me?'
</p>

<p>
'None.  I assure you, Captain Goring, I
miss Alison very much, and so does my
child here, little Netty.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;little Netty, whose "flower-like
beauty," as he calls it, Dalton is never
weary praising.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney's colour heightened for a
moment, her long lashes flickered, but she
merely said,
</p>

<p>
'How is Captain Dalton?  I have not
seen him for some time.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well&mdash;but low-spirited apparently,'
replied Goring, who thought that 'she
seemed interested in poor Tony after all.'
</p>

<p>
After a pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Dalton is my dearest friend, Mrs. Trelawney,
and, as the confidant of his secrets,
he has not concealed from me his deep
admiration and love of yourself.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney's bright hazel eyes
sparkled, and her bosom heaved, while an
undoubtedly joyous expression spread over
all her animated face.
</p>

<p>
'You will pardon me for saying this,
when I know that you are the friend of
Alison Cheyne, whom I love with my whole
life, and shall follow over the world if I
can trace her!' said Goring, whose voice
trembled with emotion that sprang from
love and anger.
</p>

<p>
'I do love sweet Alison very dearly.'
</p>

<p>
'And poor Dalton,' said Goring, anxious
to plead his friend's cause; 'can you not
love him as he deserves to be?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not said so,' replied Mrs. Trelawney,
now laughing excessively, and added,
'what an odd question for a gentleman
visitor!'
</p>

<p>
'Do pardon me; but will you give him
time to hope&mdash;through me?'
</p>

<p>
'Please not to suggest this, Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?
</p>

<p>
'There is&mdash;I know&mdash;a secret in his life&mdash;he
knows it too&mdash;a secret that in some measure
fetters alike his words and his actions.'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens! and this secret?'
</p>

<p>
'Is mine also&mdash;I have the key to it.'
</p>

<p>
'Yours!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;you look perplexed&mdash;even distressed;
nevertheless it is so,' she rejoined,
tapping the floor, as if impatient, with a
slim and pretty foot.
</p>

<p>
'Will it ever be unravelled?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;very soon now, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'But when?'
</p>

<p>
'When the proper time comes.  Till
then, Captain Goring, I shall trust to your
friendship for myself and Captain Dalton
not to attempt to probe it, or act the
umpire or match-maker between us.'
</p>

<p>
She said this emphatically, and with one
of her sweetest smiles, while her soft white
hand was placed confidently in that of
Goring.
</p>

<p>
'I shall be silent as the grave,' said he.
'I have suspected something of this kind.
At times a great gloom comes over poor
Tony; there has been some mystery about
his early life; what, I cannot divine; but it
drove him into the ranks, and made him for
years loathe England and English society,
which he avoided as much as possible.  He
seems to have got over that whim now, and
to you I look forward as the means of
effecting a perfect cure.'
</p>

<p>
She gave Goring one of her soft and
inexplicable smiles, and then, drooping her
eyelids said, with a sigh, but apparently
one of pleasure,
</p>

<p>
'You expect too much from me, Captain
Goring.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney promised him, the moment
she could obtain, through any source,
some tidings of Alison's whereabouts, to let
him know, and he bade her adieu with his
mind full of doubt and anxiety&mdash;not doubt
of Alison's faith, but of their mutual future;
and anxiety for the annoyances to which
she might be subjected, and the pressure
that might in many ways be put upon her.
</p>

<p>
That Cadbury was in her society was an
irritating circumstance; but a peer of the
realm was some one of consequence, and
his movements would ere long most probably
be a clue to hers.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney's mysterious hints about
her knowledge of Dalton's past life gave
Goring some food for reflection, and he
knew not what to think of them.
</p>

<p>
'So&mdash;she seems to have refused Tony, as
she did Jerry Wilmot; by Jove, she must
be difficult to please!' thought he, as he
turned his horse in the direction of Aldershot,
often giving a long, earnest, and hopeless
farewell glance at the old trysting-place
beside the beeches.
</p>

<p>
But Jerry by this time had quite got
over his fancy for Mrs. Trelawney, and
found a new divinity in the person of her
friend, Miss Bella Chevenix, whom he had
known from her girlhood, but who now became
invested with new and sudden interest
to him.
</p>

<p>
Days passed slowly in succession now,
but to Goring there came no tidings of the
absent one.  Thus life in the winter camp
at Aldershot became an intolerable bore to
him, and he longed for action of any kind;
but now rumours went abroad that troubles
were in store at the Cape, and the regiment
would be one of the first dispatched to
Africa.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
WILMOTHURST.
</h3>

<p>
His changed mood of mind did not
escape the attention of his friend
Jerry Wilmot, who said to him one day,
</p>

<p>
'My people at Wilmothurst are getting
up a spread, or a dinner, or both, in honour
of my august appearance in this world some
five-and-twenty years ago.  Get leave with
me from the Colonel, and we'll start by
train from Farnborough.  Tell your man to
throw your things together; O'Farrel is
packing mine, and I am just going to the
orderly-room about it.'
</p>

<p>
Goring agreed to this.  The colonel
readily granted a few weeks' leave to both,
as the spring drills were a long way off, or
the alternate mud and dust of the Long
Valley were not sufficiently deep for
military manœuvres; and they started for
Wilmothurst, which was situated in one of the
prettiest and most wooded parts of Hampshire,
Goring being glad of anything that
drew him from his own thoughts and aided
him to kill the harassing time.
</p>

<p>
Jerry's man secured their seats and saw
their luggage duly placed in the van.
</p>

<p>
'Now, O'Farrel,' said he, as the latter
saluted and retired, 'don't get drunk at the
"Tumble-down-Dick," or you'll never be the
Sultan of Turkey.'
</p>

<p>
Farnborough Station was soon left far
behind; Fleet, with its pond and moorlands;
Winchfield, Basingstoke, with its
market and town-hall.  The carriage from
Wilmothurst met them at a station some
miles eastward of Salisbury, and the short
winter evening saw them deposited at the
<i>porte-cochère</i> of the stately modern mansion,
which occupied the site of an ancient one,
and of which Jerry was the lord and owner.
</p>

<p>
'A fine place this, Jerry,' exclaimed
Goring as they alighted; 'the grounds are
beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, but the devil of it is that the lands
are mortgaged, I believe, to an awful
extent; my father was a man of expensive
habits and tastes.  The old lady <i>ma mère</i>
hopes, nay, never doubts, that I shall, with
my handsome figure and rare accomplishments,
pick up an heiress, as if such prizes
were to be found like pips on every hedge;
but I have my own fancy to consult in the
matter of marriage.'
</p>

<p>
And Jerry laughed softly as he looked
at his watch and added,
</p>

<p>
'Now to dress for dinner, and then I
shall introduce you to the ladies in the
drawing-room.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry had, during the last few weeks,
especially since his fancy for Mrs. Trelawney
had been cooled by her laughing repulse of
his suit, gone much after Bella Chevenix, a
former flame, wherever he had met her&mdash;a
young lady of whom we shall have much to
tell anon&mdash;but, as yet, he had given no
token of his actual feelings towards her,
save a rather marked attention, which
she&mdash;knowing the views, the necessities, and,
more than all, the general bearing of Lady
Julia Wilmot towards herself&mdash;had never in
any way encouraged.
</p>

<p>
Goring followed up the stately, richly-carpeted,
and warmly-lighted staircase the
valet, who conducted him to his room,
where he found his clothes already unpacked,
his evening costume placed on a clothes-rail
before a blazing fire, and, as he turned
to the great mirror and magnificent toilette
table, he thought, with a repining sigh, if
something like these luxurious surroundings
of which Jerry made so light were his, how
different might be the fate or fortune of his
engagement with Alison Cheyne.
</p>

<p>
With soldier-like rapidity he and Jerry
made the necessary changes in their
costume; the latter tapped at his door, and
together they descended to the spacious
drawing-room, before the blazing fire in
which, at the end of a long vista, apparently
of pictures, pilasters, and window-draperies,
two ladies were seated.
</p>

<p>
Lady Julia Wilmot (she was an Earl's
daughter) received them with a stately grace
peculiar to herself, but she was too well-bred
to display the least warmth of manner;
and Jerry kissed her cheek, then her firm,
white hand, and, after introducing 'Goring
of Ours,' saluted his pretty cousin.
</p>

<p>
Lady Julia was a fine-looking woman
past her fortieth year, but still very
handsome, her complexion brilliantly pure, her
face and forehead without a line, for thought
and care had been alike unknown to her
since she left her cradle.  Her delicately
pencilled black eyebrows and general outline
of features were decidedly what are deemed
aristocratic, and she gave her hand to
Goring, while receiving somewhat frigidly
Jerry's kiss upon her white cheek.
</p>

<p>
She was not emotional evidently, and
deemed that any exhibition of pleasure on
seeing her only son after an absence of a
few months would be 'bad form.'
</p>

<p>
Emily Wilmot was decidedly a pretty
girl, with blond hair, light blue eyes, a
rather <i>retroussé</i> nose, a cherub-like mouth
and dazzling skin.
</p>

<p>
'My cousin Emily,' said Jerry, 'Goring
of Ours.  I hope you will be great friends,
but be careful, Emmy.  Bevil is our regimental
lady-killer&mdash;has passed the Guards'
School of Instruction in the science of flirtation.'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd as ever, Jerry,' said his pretty
cousin, tapping his hand with her feather
fan, but beginning a conversation at once
with Goring.
</p>

<p>
Aware that Jerry would arrive that day
about dinner time, Cousin Emily had made
her toilette with unusual care.  She wore a
rich black silk trimmed with amber satin;
ruffles of rich old lace fell around her
tapered arms that were white as a lily, and
made the delicate lace seem quite yellow.
Bracelets of topazes clasped her slender
wrists.  The colours chosen became the
blond character of her beauty&mdash;for she was
more than pretty&mdash;and yet the whole
costume, though rather extreme, was not too
much for a family dinner.
</p>

<p>
During the progress of the latter, which
was protracted by an infinity of <i>entrées</i> and
courses, yet was perfect in all its details,
the quartette, on whom the butler and two
tall valets were in attendance, found plenty
to talk of.  The expected departure of the
regiment and other troops to the scene of a
coming war in Africa; the last run with the
Royal Buckhounds; the county news; the
coming ball; who were invited and who
were not, as ineligible; and some of the
conversation on this mooted point reminded
Bevil Goring of the proclivities of Sir Ranald
Cheyne, as also did the amount of heraldry
displayed on plate, the china, and everything,
from the great silver epergne to the
fruit knives, but it was precisely the same
with my Lord Cadbury, the man of yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Here, however, it was, 'the genuine
article;' on a <i>fesse</i> three eagles' heads and
as many escalop shells, gules, crested with
the eagle's head of Wilmot, given to the
first of the name, Wyliamot, who, according
to Dugdale, was settled antecedent to the
Conquest in Nottinghamshire, though,
unfortunately for Dugdale's veracity, the science
of heraldry was unknown in England till
long after that event.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Chevenix wishes to see you on
some important business to-morrow, Jerry,'
said Lady Wilmot, when the dessert was
over and the servants had withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
'All right, mater; I'll ride over to-morrow
probably&mdash;nay, certainly.  Try the
burgundy, Goring; there are Romanée,
Conti, and Chablis before you.'
</p>

<p>
'The latter&mdash;thanks, Jerry.'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Chevenix is at home just now,'
observed Lady Wilmot, with a furtive
glance at her son.
</p>

<p>
'I know; she returned, or was to return, yesterday.'
</p>

<p>
'You seem well aware of her movements;
but of what interest are they to you, Jerry?'
</p>

<p>
'Every pretty girl's movements are of
interest to me,' replied Jerry, laughing.
</p>

<p>
There was a mischievous pout on Cousin
Emily's pouting lips, that were like two
rose-buds; but his mother's curled slightly
with disdain.
</p>

<p>
'She is handsome, certainly,' said Jerry,
emphatically; 'appeal to Goring that she is.'
</p>

<p>
'And rather good style, considering her
origin,' added Lady Wilmot.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it is better surely to be all that
than plain.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Cela dépend</i>,' laughed Cousin Emily; 'it
makes no difference to me.'
</p>

<p>
But Jerry knew that it did make a difference;
however, he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'You, Emily, may well afford to hear
any woman praised.'
</p>

<p>
'But what can Mr. Chevenix want with
you, Jerry?' asked Lady Julia.
</p>

<p>
'Can't say, mater dear&mdash;business or some
such bother, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'People of his class should wait till they
are sent for.'
</p>

<p>
'His class?'
</p>

<p>
'Well; he is only a village attorney.'
</p>

<p>
'A very fine old man, who has had many
business transactions with the governor
before my time.'
</p>

<p>
'Slang again, Jerry!  Does he pick up
all that kind of thing in barracks, Captain
Goring?'
</p>

<p>
'Very probably; it is the style of the day,'
replied Goring, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'It is a very bad style, Jerry dear,' said
Emily, gently.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I repeat,' said the hostess, haughtily,
'that persons like Chevenix should not send
for their superiors, but wait till they are
sent for.'
</p>

<p>
'Like Chevenix; how you run on, mother.
One would think that the old days of sitting
below the salt had come again!' exclaimed
Jerry, with a somewhat ruffled air.  'As
the world goes now, how long do you think
this vast distinction of class and class will
last?  Why, nobility itself will one day
pass away&mdash;nay, respect for it is nearly a
thing of the past already.'
</p>

<p>
'Nobility pass away!' exclaimed Lady
Julia, the descendant of twenty earls and
more, her pale face growing paler at such
unheard-of opinion.  'Where have you
picked up such horrid Radical and
Communistic ideas, Jerry?  Not in the army
surely!'
</p>

<p>
'I pick them up from the public prints,
yet don't endorse them.  But to me it
seems that all will go in time, and quietly
now, as no one will care to make a row
about it.  Don't you see the terrible
tendency of the times?  I call them terrible
from your point of view, mother.  Even the
dignity of the Crown is slighted in almost
every debate in the Lower House now by
some fellow or other; and to me all this
seems to foreshadow the coming time when
the Crown itself may fall into the dust without
defenders, for there will be no Cavaliers
in England to send their plate to the
melting pot and mount their serving men,
and no loyal clans in the North to descend
again under a Montrose or Dundee.'
</p>

<p>
'And all this is to come to pass because
I don't approve of old Mr. Chevenix,' said
Lady Julia, rather scornfully, as she fanned
herself; and, then bowing to Goring, she
nodded to Miss Wilmot, and both rising
sailed away to the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Goring read a peculiar expression in the
fine face of the elder lady as she withdrew,
and it gave him a clue to some of Jerry's
movements lately; but he made no reference
to it, nor would it have been courteous to
do so, familiar as he and Jerry were.
</p>

<p>
Jerry twirled his moustaches with a
momentary air of annoyance.  It was evident
that there existed some secret bone of
contention between mother and son&mdash;a
skeleton in the cupboard at Wilmothurst;
but who could have supposed that this
ghastly personage was in reality the brilliant
and blooming Bella Chevenix!
</p>

<p>
And when, after having a few glasses of
wine together, and a cigar in the smoking-room,
they rejoined the ladies in the
drawing-room, the obnoxious subject was again
resumed by Jerry and his mother, somewhat
apart from Bevil Goring, who drew a
seat near the piano, over the keys of which
Miss Wilmot was gracefully idling, or affecting
an <i>andante</i> of Beethoven.
</p>

<p>
'The invitations for the ball in your honour,
my dear boy, are all issued,' said Lady Julia;
'and every one has accepted&mdash;only think of
that!  Every one, and here is the list.'
</p>

<p>
He scanned it, and saw many familiar
names that stood high in the county, and
said, with a twirl of his moustache,
</p>

<p>
'I don't see the name of Chevenix here.'
</p>

<p>
'Chevenix again!' said his mother, with
a cloudy eye and curling lip; 'the lawyer
man?'
</p>

<p>
'Who else, mother dear?  Now, don't
be absurd.  There is no other Chevenix in
all Hampshire.  They must be asked&mdash;he
and his daughter.'
</p>

<p>
'The girl is said to look well in a drawing-room.'
</p>

<p>
'She looks lovely!' exclaimed Jerry,
incautiously.
</p>

<p>
'She was a mere hobbledehoy when you
and she used to play at battledore and
croquet together.'
</p>

<p>
'She is, I repeat, a very lovely woman
now, mother,' continued Jerry, with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
'You have seen her lately?' asked the
elderly lady, in a casual tone.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; often at a hop in Willis's Rooms,
at the camp balls, with the buckhounds, and
at Mrs. Trelawney's.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is Mrs. Trelawney?' asked Lady
Julia, languidly, while elevating her
delicately pencilled eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
'A widow who lives near Aldershot, at a
place called Chilcote Grange.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!'
</p>

<p>
Jerry laughed softly, as he thought how
familiar his lady-mother might have been
with the fair widow's name had she not
rejected his attention, and laughed him off
cavalierly as he thought at the time.
</p>

<p>
'There is every reason in the world why
we must have Miss Chevenix, mother,'
persisted Jerry, colouring with vexation as he
returned to the charge; 'she is highly
accomplished, and sings well.'
</p>

<p>
'Taught well, no doubt&mdash;people of that
kind send their children to the best schools
now.
</p>

<p>
'I should like you to hear her voice.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;not here, at all events,' said
Lady Julia, shrugging her shoulders, 'the
girl must be forward enough&mdash;rides with
the buckhounds, you say?'
</p>

<p>
'Every one does.'
</p>

<p>
'The reason, perhaps, she goes there.'
</p>

<p>
'I can assure you, mother, that Bel&mdash;Miss
Chevenix&mdash;is a very proud girl.'
</p>

<p>
'Likely enough&mdash;many vulgarians are;
but, if she is so proud as you say, we must
teach her what her real position is&mdash;the
daughter of a village attorney&mdash;of our local
agent&mdash;the granddaughter of a farmer.'
</p>

<p>
'One of the oldest families on the estate.'
</p>

<p>
'Enough&mdash;she will make the hundred
and fourth person invited.'
</p>

<p>
'If she accepts,' said Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'<i>If</i> she accepts!' repeated his mother,
with elevated brows, as she added the girl's
name to her list, and tossed the golden pen
from her white jewelled fingers.
</p>

<p>
'At the last meet at Salthill, she came
with Miss Cheyne of Essilmont,' said Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'I have heard of that girl&mdash;the daughter
of a broken-down Scottish baronet.  But all
kinds of horrid people go, with the highest
in rank, to these rough gatherings.'
</p>

<p>
'Glad Goring did not hear you,' said
Jerry, glancing nervously towards the pair
at the piano.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'He is rather spooney in that quarter.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't use camp slang, Jerry&mdash;which
quarter&mdash;the Chevenix girl?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Miss Cheyne,' replied her son, in a
low voice.
</p>

<p>
'Emily,' said Lady Julia, 'I have added
that girl's name to our list&mdash;you will see
that an invitation is sent to her and her
father to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, aunt,' replied Emily, with a slight
shade of annoyance on her naturally sweet
face.  'Was it not she who behaved so
shockingly to Colonel Graves, of the Artillery?'
</p>

<p>
'It was Graves&mdash;the utter cad&mdash;who behaved
shockingly to her, poor girl,'
exclaimed Jerry, with warmth.
</p>

<p>
'Really, Jerry, you must keep your temper.
See how you have made Emily blush.'
</p>

<p>
'Mother!'
</p>

<p>
'You are quite pugnacious in defence of
this young woman; but please now let us
drop the subject.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear mother,' said Jerry, good-humouredly,
and kissing her cheek, as he
had now gained his point, 'the male public
generally, and particularly that portion of
it who wear the red rag, are rather subject
to the blandishments of the fair sex, and are
not all able to resist them, like St. Anthony
the Abbot in his wood at Coma.'
</p>

<p>
'You make a jest of everything, Jerry,'
said Lady Julia; 'but,' she added, under
cover of Emily's musical performance, 'it
has been said that no one knows how people
pick up "a knowledge of others' antecedents
from their own careless talk;" thus,
my dear boy, I am glad you did not become
entangled by that dreadful Trelawney
woman.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry, the rogue, thought so now himself,
but he coloured deeply at this abrupt
remark, as it showed him that his mother
knew much more of his movements than he
in the least suspected.
</p>

<p>
His pretty cousin Emily, the orphan
daughter of his father's younger brother,
evidently had a <i>penchant</i> for him; her
jealousy of any rival was easily excited; and
thus she shared to the full all his mother's
overstrained prejudices against Bella Chevenix,
and, finding that he was still somewhat
indifferent to her charms, she might doubtless
have had no objection to get up a little
affair with Bevil Goring.  But the latter
was too preoccupied to relish her vivacity
or respond to it, and, though companionable
enough, she found him full of his own
thoughts, and at times indifferent to a
provoking degree.
</p>

<p>
When the ladies retired for the night,
and Jerry joined Goring in the smoking-room
to have a last whiff, with some seltzer
and brandy, he found the latter deep in
studying the geography of the Mediterranean,
a map of which he had pulled out
from a stand of maps on rollers.
</p>

<p>
'What is up, old fellow?' said Jerry;
'going in for cramming again?  Thought
you were surely done with that beastly
work.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven, yes; but look here!'
</p>

<p>
Goring had first seen the papers that had
come by the evening post, and been cut and
laid out by the butler.  He had, as usual,
turned to the shipping and fashionable
intelligence, and to all the paragraphed news,
in search of tidings of the lost one, and had
alighted at last on an announcement in the
<i>Times</i> that Lord Cadbury's yacht, the <i>Firefly</i>,
'with Sir Ranald Cheyne and a small
but select party on board,' had sailed for
the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
Now this was not the case, as the notice
had been inserted by Slagg, in obedience to
the peer, as a blind to Goring in particular,
while the 'small and select party' consisted
only of poor Alison herself.
</p>

<p>
'The Mediterranean,' said Jerry, as he
lit a Havanna; 'that is a wide word&mdash;you
can't make much of that in the hope of
overhauling the yacht.'
</p>

<p>
Bevil acquiesced in the fact, and that it
would be almost impossible as yet to trace
its route or whereabouts.  He had but one
comfort, though somewhat a negative one,
that her father was with her; yet he knew
not the real character of Lord Cadbury, nor
the plans he was capable of contriving,
encouraged by his own great wealth on the
one hand, and the poverty and age of Sir
Ranald on the other, with the girl's utter
helplessness if she were, by any means,
deprived of the latter's protection, now that
the stings of jealousy and revenge against
himself, Goring, were added to Alison's
rejection of his hand, with all the brilliant
settlements attached to it.
</p>

<p>
Then there would come into Bevil's heart
fears that without his love to support her,
and his occasional presence to sway her
gentle spirit, it might be gradually bent, if
not broken, under the united influence of
Cadbury with his wealth, and her father
with his pride and poverty; and he drew
many a harrowing picture of promises being
perhaps wrung from her, by which she
might eventually be lost to him for ever.
</p>

<p>
As it seemed now, she had been spirited
away, taken out of his life suddenly&mdash;had
passed, as it were, out of the scheme of his
existence.
</p>

<p>
They had been parted roughly, without
their hearts resting on the joy of that future
which lovers alone look forward to.
</p>

<p>
Day and night he thought of her, his lost
Alison.  Gathering&mdash;hoarding, as it were, in
his inner heart, 'as a miser hoards his
gold&mdash;memories of passion-laden eyes seeking
his, and then often long looks of fondness
turned aside' lest others saw their glories,
and of stolen kisses, stolen from lips that
quivered and trembled for their own
temerity and ardour.
</p>

<p>
He could but think again, alas for the
time that has been!
</p>

  Will never come back to me.'<br>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
MR. CHEVENIX'S BUSINESS.
</h3>

<p>
With all his erratic habits and general
thoughtlessness, Jerry Wilmot was
not without a capacity for business; thus on
the evening after his return home he rode
over to the village of Wilmothurst to visit
Mr. Chevenix ostensibly as to matters
connected with the estate, and with the decided
desire, no doubt, of seeing the brilliant
Bella.
</p>

<p>
The village consisted of a few houses, an
ancient church of Norman times, with a
squat square tower, covered with ivy, a
spacious green, overlooked by an old
thatched inn with a swinging signboard; and
opposite stood the comfortable, two-storeyed
mansion of Mr. Chevenix, who acted as
legal adviser in small matters, as factor, and
land agent for the Wilmots and other county
families.
</p>

<p>
A kindly-mannered and benign-looking
old man, he received Jerry in his cosy
dining-room with considerable warmth, and
the handsome Bella fairly blushed with
pleasure on seeing her acknowledged
admirer; and Jerry, when he saw the rare
beauty of the girl, thought how thankful he
should be that the widow had not accepted
him!
</p>

<p>
At Wilmothurst Bella enjoyed the
reputation of being the best organiser of
pleasant picnics in the sunny summer-time, the
great designer of games and charades at
Christmastide, the most tasteful decorator
of the village church for festivals, a kind
friend to the poor and all the little ones of
the hamlet.
</p>

<p>
Yet none shone brighter or better at the
balls in Brighton or elsewhere out of her
narrow home circle; she was a dashing
horsewoman in the field; but seemed always
most in her element when seated over some
piece of feminine work by her old father's
side, as Jerry now found her, in the
flower-scented and lamp-lit little dining-room
surrounded by all the home influences her
presence caused.
</p>

<p>
Jerry knew now precisely how Bella was
viewed by his mother and cousin, and this
repressed&mdash;if not his ardour&mdash;the scope of
his attentions.
</p>

<p>
The haughty Bella also knew from a
thousand petty instances how Lady Julia
Wilmot viewed her position in society, and
resented it accordingly, for she was one of
the many in and about Wilmothurst who
had felt the sting of that lady's 'snub,' and
were against her in consequence.  Thus her
first thought had been to decline the
invitation to the ball, which had reached her
that forenoon.  Then on consideration came
the knowledge that to do so would cause
much local speculation, that many might
infer she had not been invited at all, and
that by her absence she would lose the
society of Jerry for a whole night; and the
girl's natural desire to outshine&mdash;as she
knew she would do&mdash;so many there, if not
all who would be present, led her to write
an acceptance.
</p>

<p>
She had done so, and at once began the
serious consideration of her costume&mdash;serious
only as to the variety to select from, for her
father was a rich man&mdash;richer than Lady
Julia Wilmot had the least idea of.
</p>

<p>
'You are coming to our ball, of course,
Miss Chevenix?' said Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'The invitation just reached me to-day,
and I have not yet posted an acceptance.'
</p>

<p>
'But you will come, of course,' urged
Jerry, looking admiringly into her bright
laughing eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I am not quite certain,' faltered Bella,
and paused.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, nonsense, she will be there readily
enough,' said her father; adding&mdash;'I think I
may be pardoned for saying it, Mr. Wilmot,
but my Bella will be the belle of the ball.
However, leave us just now, dear.  Mr. Wilmot
has come to see me on business, I
doubt not, and that won't be interesting to
you.'
</p>

<p>
She at once took up her work-basket,
and withdrew, with a bow and a smile, and
Jerry, as his gaze followed her, and he saw
what a perfect creature she was, so slim
and graceful with the pure complexion
that comes of health and country air, soft
and sparkling brown eyes and rich hair
coiled round a shapely head, thought how
unworthy it was of his mother to view the
girl as she did, and to treat her as she had
hitherto done.
</p>

<p>
He knew exactly from what her indecision
about the ball sprang.  Never before
had she or her father been invited to the
Manor House when other guests were
there, at dinner or garden parties, and
when they had dined with her and Miss
Wilmot, in solitary state, she always resented
bitterly the airs of patronage which Lady
Julia adopted.
</p>

<p>
'She's going to the ball, never fear,
Mr. Jerry, and there is her reply on the
mantel-piece,' said her father.
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to be the bearer of it,' said
Jerry, transferring it at once to his pocket.
</p>

<p>
'And, now through the medium of some
brandy and water, we shall turn to business
matters.'
</p>

<p>
'Glad to hear you say so,' replied Jerry;
'I have wished much to see you, Chevenix,
about money matters.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chevenix smiled faintly, and coughed
slightly behind his hand.
</p>

<p>
'How has it been that of late so little has
been paid into my bank account,' said
Jerry, 'and that I have had such difficulty
in squaring matters at Aldershot; even in
meeting my losses on the last Divisional
Steeplechase, and in many other things;
that in fact both the mater and myself are
often short of the "ready"?'
</p>

<p>
'The estate, you are aware, was heavily
mortgaged by your late worthy father.'
</p>

<p>
'I have heard that a hundred times, and
know it to my cost,' replied Jerry, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'And since you joined the army you
must also be aware that, to meet the many
requirements of yourself and Lady Julia, I
have had to effect other mortgages, for
instance, on Langley Park (which my
forefathers farmed under yours for more than
two centuries), on the forty acres of Upton
Stoke, and on Hazelwood; that, in short, all
these may never be yours again, as I see no
way of your removing these encumbrances,
save by a wealthy marriage; and that the
good lady, your mother, has not the slightest
idea of the extent of the evil and all
your liabilities.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' exclaimed Jerry, 'these are
pleasant things to listen to.'
</p>

<p>
There was a silence between them for a
time, and Jerry took a long sip at his
brandy and seltzer.  With all his admiration
and certainly growing love for the
handsome Bella, she seemed to be receding
from him in the distance now.
</p>

<p>
'I am deeply sorry to tell you these
things, Mr. Wilmot,' said Chevenix, who had
genuine respect and love for the listener,
and really had the well-being of the old
family at heart; 'it is a serious thing for a
young man like you, the inheritor of a good
old name, bred with expensive tastes and
so forth, to find yourself hampered and
trammelled thus at your very outset of life,
but so it is.'
</p>

<p>
'We live and learn, Mr. Chevenix,' said
Jerry, with unusual bitterness for him.
</p>

<p>
'True,' added his old agent,
</p>

<p>
'We live and learn, but not the <i>wiser</i>
grow, says John Pomfret.'
</p>

<p>
'And who the devil is he?' asked Jerry, testily.
</p>

<p>
'A poet and divine of the seventeenth century.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry sat staring into the fire as if
bewildered by the sudden revelation&mdash;this new
state of things.
</p>

<p>
'And who holds all the infernal mortgages?'
asked Jerry, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
'I do&mdash;they are in the iron safe on
yonder shelf.'
</p>

<p>
'You; and who advanced all this money
to my father, and to myself latterly?'
</p>

<p>
'I did&mdash;every shilling to the old squire
and to you, Mr. Jerry; but do not be
alarmed&mdash;do not be alarmed&mdash;I have no
intention of foreclosing.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry was more thunderstruck than ever.
Here was another startling revelation.  He
found that more than half of his paternal
estate was in the hands of the very man
whose daughter he had been learning to
love in secret, and whom his proud mother
so heartily disliked and publicly slighted.
</p>

<p>
He had hinted, as related, of mortgages
on the evening of his arrival with Bevil
Goring, but this state of matters he was
altogether unprepared for.  In short, it
would seem as if but a moiety of his property
remained to him, and that the heiress
of it all was Bella Chevenix!
</p>

<p>
Bella, the daughter of the village attorney,
'the lawyer man,' as Lady Julia called
him, whose forefathers did yeoman service
to his, and farmed old Langley Park.
</p>

<p>
'Take courage&mdash;you have yet time to
look about you, and money, if it can be
procured from some other source, may repair
these evils,' said Mr. Chevenix, kindly; but
he knew not what was then in Jerry's mind.
That in reality a love for Bella had been
fast becoming the ruling thought of his life;
that on learning she had returned to
Wilmothurst he had arranged to return home
also, and had made up his mind, despite his
mother's pride and opposition, to propose
for the girl; but dared he do so now?
</p>

<p>
Their positions were completely reversed,
and were he to do so she would never believe
in his love or view him as other than
a pretender, who offered it in barter for the
mortgages her father held on his estate.
</p>

<p>
The latter was eyeing Jerry, and, having
no idea of what his secret thoughts were,
failed to see why, if even a half of his estate
remained, he should seem so suddenly
overcome, for he had grown very pale, and he
respired like one in pain.
</p>

<p>
To thrust all love for Bella out of his
heart was now the bitter task to which he
must set himself, and perhaps to replace
her image by one of the many heiresses to
whom his mother so often drew his attention;
but that could not be.  Jolly, good-hearted
Jerry would never condescend to
be mercenary; he felt that he would rather
a thousand times share poverty with a loving
little girl like Bella than wealth with
another.  Matters had not yet come to
poverty&mdash;far from it; but now, and after all that
had transpired, and he had learned who the
holder of these fatal mortgages was, how
could he speak to her or her father of love
or marriage without being most cruelly and
degradingly misunderstood, and having his
object utterly misconstrued?
</p>

<p>
'And the interest on the mortgages?' he
asked, in a hard, dry tone.
</p>

<p>
'Has been unpaid for several years.'
</p>

<p>
'Making matters worse and worse.  It
was six per cent. on Langley Park, Mr. Chevenix,
and that is stiff interest as things go.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, it <i>was</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'You speak of it in the past tense.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Worse and worse,' assented Mr. Chevenix,
shaking his white head.  'But bear up, my
dear boy.  I may call you so?' added the
old man, kindly patting Jerry's shoulder.
'Money will pull you through.  A handsome
young fellow like you, with your family
prestige, will easily find a rich wife, and an
officer has a hundred chances of success
when other fellows have none.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry had not the heart to ask what the
total sum of his liabilities amounted to, and
rose to depart.
</p>

<p>
'Bid Miss Chevenix good-bye for me,'
said he, as he departed in haste, having just
then no desire to add to the intense
mortification that crushed him by looking again
on the bright face of the unconscious
Bella&mdash;for unconscious she was of what their
mutual monetary relations were till her
father some time after informed her, when
the news came to her perhaps too late.
</p>

<p>
Sunk in thoughts too bitter for words,
Jerry rode slowly home through the dusk
of the gloomy winter evening.  The barriers
raised by evil fortune, and added to by a
sense of honour and propriety, enhanced in
his eyes the value of the girl he felt that
he had lost, and rendered dearer to him
the hopes he had been cherishing of late,
and which had become so precious to him.
</p>

<p>
He longed for the society and advice of
Goring over a 'quiet weed' to talk about
these things ere he confided the state of
matters to his mother, who, with all her
great love of him, he feared could not be
brought to see how matters stood with regard
to the estate and the encumbrances thereon.
</p>

<p>
When he joined her in the drawing-room
before dinner, the careworn expression of
his face&mdash;an expression all unusual to
him&mdash;certainly struck her, but for a time only.
</p>

<p>
'You have been with Mr. Chevenix?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mother.'
</p>

<p>
'And he has worried you with business.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; his daughter is coming to the ball.
Here is her reply; I brought it with me,'
said he, with an irrepressible sigh.
</p>

<p>
'Of course she will come; who ever
doubted it?' responded Lady Julia, as she
somewhat contemptuously tossed Bella's
unopened note into the fire; and Jerry turned
away to join Goring and his cousin Emily,
who were looking over a portfolio of prints
upon a stand of gilded wood.
</p>

<p>
To Jerry at this precise time the familiar
yet gorgeous drawing-room, with all its
inlaid cabinets and brackets, bearing treasures
of art and <i>bric-a-brac</i>, as seen under the
soft light of wax candles in sconces and the
glittering crystal chandelier, gave a sense
of worry by its apparent incongruity, as did
the very attire of his mother and cousin by
the richness of its materials, the laces, the
jewelry; and he absolutely shivered when
he thought of the coming birthday ball, with
its hundred and four guests on one hand,
and the mortgages of Chevenix with their
unpaid interest on the other.
</p>

<p>
To Jerry it seemed that ere long his
mother might have to betake herself to
Bruges or Boulogne to retrench, while he
might have to exchange for India if the
route came not speedily for Africa.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring, when they were alone,
heard with genuine concern the state of
affairs as Jerry set them before him, and
agreed with him that to continue his
attentions to Miss Chevenix would lead to
an entire misconstruction on the part of
herself and her father as to the true state of
his heart, and lead them to infer that he
was only a fortune-hunter; and honest Jerry
blushed scarlet at the name, and twirled and
gnawed his moustache with intense irritation.
</p>

<p>
Though she failed to take in the whole
situation&mdash;which Jerry knew would be the
case&mdash;Lady Julia heard his tidings with
considerable alarm, and felt her wrath
increased against Mr. Chevenix, which was
utterly unreasonable.
</p>

<p>
'The state of our&mdash;or rather your&mdash;affairs,
as this man has set them before you,
Jerry,' said Lady Julia, 'now renders it
absolutely necessary that you should marry
for money, and that at once.'
</p>

<p>
'Or cut the service and emigrate,' groaned
Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'Emigrate!'
</p>

<p>
'Invest in a pickaxe and spade, and try
Ballarat or the Diamond Fields.'
</p>

<p>
'How can you jest thus?' said his mother,
loftily.
</p>

<p>
'To me the nearest heiress seems to be
Bella Chevenix,' said Jerry, not unwilling
to revenge her for the slighting remarks his
mother daily made.
</p>

<p>
'She has a fortune certainly&mdash;a fortune
won by advances made upon our lands&mdash;but
of what use can it be to her, brought
up, as she has been, ignorant of the habits,
the tastes, and requirements of our class?'
</p>

<p>
'She is ignorant of none, and enjoys them
all,' replied Jerry, with some asperity.
</p>

<p>
'You inherited the estate encumbered,
and have, in no small degree, added to its
burdens, and, if you do not make a rich
marriage, may be&mdash;my poor, dear Jerry&mdash;a
ruined man.'
</p>

<p>
'We are going to fight King Koffee, they
say.  I'll get taken prisoner, and marry his
youngest daughter!' cried Jerry, with a
gleam of his old recklessness.
</p>

<p>
For some days now he did not go near
Bella Chevenix, who began to feel a little
wroth at him in consequence, as she had
no key as yet to what influenced Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'Their ball!' exclaimed the proud girl,
petulantly; 'I am not sure that I should go,
papa, to be patronised and slighted perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Patronised or slighted&mdash;who dare do
either to you?' asked her father, with
surprise.
</p>

<p>
'I shall be bored to death, I fear.'
</p>

<p>
But the desire to appear where she knew
she would shine prevailed over all her
doubts, and she devoted all her energies to
have a costume that should be second to
none.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jerry found the impossibility
of abstaining entirely from visiting the house
of Mr. Chevenix, and so days of meetings
in various ways passed&mdash;meetings in which
their lives seemed to be mutually merged in
that sweet occupation which was not quite
love-making, but yet was far, far in advance
of that perilous frivolity that so often leads
to it called&mdash;flirtation.
</p>

<p>
Yet Jerry was further now from disclosing
himself than ever, and Bella seemed in
no hurry for him to do so, for she was
young enough&mdash;even after all she had seen
of society&mdash;to shrink from a declaration, for
to a girl there is something so seductive,
so sweet in hovering on the brink, when
she, as Bella did in her secret heart, loves
the man.
</p>

<p>
Cousin Emily was not slow in discovering
the direction in which Jerry so often
turned his horse's head, and hinted thereof
to Lady Julia.
</p>

<p>
'But for the dangers my poor boy will
have to encounter,' said the latter, 'I would
hail with pleasure his departure to the coast
of Africa, as a useful means of separating
him from this most artful creature.'
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile an influx of visitors and
guests preluded the ball, as many came
from a considerable distance.  Like Goring,
Jerry was in no mood for all this gaiety just
then, and the latter resented that his duties
as host enforced his presence at Wilmothurst,
and consequent absence from Bella
Chevenix.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
THE FIREFLY.
</h3>

<p>
The red sun of a clear winter day was
shining on the two chalky eminences
at the embouchure of the Arques, or
Bethune, and on the low tongue of land
between them, whereon is situated the
seaport of Dieppe in Normandy, from the
church of which the coast of England can
be distinctly seen, when the <i>Firefly</i>, which
really was a beautiful yacht, crept slowly
along on a wind under the lee of the shore,
from which she was rather more than a
mile distant.
</p>

<p>
She was a taut-rigged craft of about two
hundred tons, and whether one regarded
the crew, the fitting of the rigging, or the
cut of the sails, it was evident that in
skilful hands she could do anything.  For a
Cowes yacht she was curiously rigged,
being a hermaphrodite&mdash;brig forward and
schooner aft.  Her foremast, like her
bowsprit, was strong and heavy, her
mainmast long and tapering.  Her upper spars
were slender and light, with topmast,
topgallant mast, and royal mast, all like
slender wands, yet capable of carrying a great
amount of canvas.  Her flush deck was
white as the driven snow, and she had eight
six pounders, all brass, and polished like
gold&mdash;bright as the copper with which she
was sheathed to the bends.
</p>

<p>
Such was the craft on board of which
Alison Cheyne found herself a species of
prisoner, and compelled to take a part in an
erratic and apparently a purposeless cruise.
To sail for Madeira had been the first
intention of Lord Cadbury, when Slagg, by
his direction, inserted in the newspapers a
paragraph to the effect that he had gone to
the Mediterranean&mdash;a paragraph expressly
designed to mislead Bevil Goring; but heavy
head-winds had prevailed, and after hanging
about in 'the Chops of the Channel'
for a week and more, the <i>Firefly</i> was standing
northward along the coast of France.
</p>

<p>
Tom Llanyard, Cadbury's captain, a
bluff-looking, curly-haired man, about forty
years of age, had been for a brief space a
warrant officer in the Royal Navy.  He
was a good-hearted fellow&mdash;not very
polished, but a thorough seaman.  He had
a secret contempt for the character of his
employer, who did not care much for yachting,
but thought it sounded well to have
such an appendage as the <i>Firefly</i> at Cowes.
Tom found the pay good; the lodging
ditto; and the duty was easy.  Tom was a
sailor or nothing; and thus being compelled
to work, 'the yacht service,' as he used to
say, 'suited him to a hair.'
</p>

<p>
He certainly thought the season a strange
one for a cruise; and as for Mr. Gaskins,
Cadbury's groom and chief valet, he utterly
loathed the whole expedition, and, connecting
it shrewdly in some way with Miss
Cheyne, he hated her with a most unholy
hatred.
</p>

<p>
To Tom Llanyard she was a new experience;
she was so totally unlike any other of
her sex he had seen on board the <i>Firefly</i>;
and he had&mdash;we are sorry to say&mdash;seen
many that were rather remarkable.
</p>

<p>
The weather had been rough, and the
poor girl, who had suffered much from sea
sickness, of a necessity remained below;
while her luckless attendant, Daisy Prune,
was utterly prostrated by the same ailment,
and the order of things was now reversed,
for Alison had to attend upon her.  The
presence of Daisy, however, was a source of
protection to the former, as it saved her
from much of the attention of Cadbury,
who had hoped that great events might be
developed or achieved by the sea voyage.
</p>

<p>
Alison's freshness was delightful to the
coarse, jaded man of the world, who, tired
at last of extravagant and congenial
dissipation (that would have horrified his
worthy father the Alderman of Threadneedle
Street), thought now of trying
domestic felicity, <i>pour se désennuyer</i>; and
truly Alison was so unlike most of the
other women he had known, or whose
acquaintance he had chosen to cultivate,
that the present opportunity gave him great
expectations of the future.
</p>

<p>
He actually reckoned upon a safe conquest,
now that he had her all to himself;
and so far as Sir Ranald was concerned,
while piling kindnesses upon him, and
pressing upon him also the best wines that the
cellar of Cadbury Court offered, he would
not have been sorry had a gale of wind
blown the pompous old baronet overboard,
and left Alison alone in the world&mdash;alone,
and at his mercy!
</p>

<p>
Leaving Sir Ranald busy with a telescope
on deck scanning the churches of
St. Jacques and St. Remy, with Le Follet and
the fisher town of Dieppe, Cadbury descended
to the luxurious and beautiful little
cabin of the yacht, the gilded and mahogany
fittings of which were exquisite, and
there found Alison&mdash;alone, as he expected.
</p>

<p>
How sad and fair, young and pure, she
looked in all the brightness of her beauty,
as her head rested against the crimson back
of the cushioned locker or sofa on which
she was seated in an attitude expressive of
utter weariness of heart.
</p>

<p>
'Alison,' said he, attempting to take her
hand.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed now, and her proud
little lip curled, as she said, 'Lord Cadbury,
when did I give you permission to call me&mdash;as
papa does&mdash;by my Christian name?'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you <i>Lord</i> me?' he asked; 'I
would you called me&mdash;Timothy,' he added,
rather faintly; and at this absurd name a
little smile flickered on Alison's pale face,
and a gesture of impatience escaped her, as
she knew that she was about to be subjected
to some more of his odious and weary
love-making.
</p>

<p>
'My passion for you made me so modest
and diffident,' said he (though in reality it
was his years), 'that I addressed myself
first to your father, though you were well
aware of the sweet hopes I fostered in my
heart, Alison.'
</p>

<p>
'It is impossible for me to listen to more
of this sort of thing, Lord Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'I can scarcely believe that your decision
is final&mdash;that you are in earnest with me.'
</p>

<p>
'Earnest!  Do you imagine, sir, that I
would jest in this matter, and&mdash;and with
you?' she exclaimed, becoming&mdash;with all
her native gentleness&mdash;tremulous with
suppressed passion.
</p>

<p>
'When once I ventured to hint of a
deeper interest in you than mere friendship,
you did not discourage me,' urged Cadbury,
who by use and wont could make love in
his own way pretty fluently now.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps I misunderstood you,&mdash;or
deemed it&mdash;deemed it&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, Alison?'
</p>

<p>
'A fatherly interest.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury winced a little at this remark.
</p>

<p>
'In anything beyond that,' continued
Alison, 'you perhaps do me honour, but in
any instance I can never love where I do
not respect and esteem.'
</p>

<p>
'And have I forfeited your esteem?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'In what way?'
</p>

<p>
'By trepanning me on board this yacht&mdash;away
from home and my friends!'
</p>

<p>
'Friends at Aldershot,' thought Cadbury,
as he laughed to himself and said,
</p>

<p>
'But why so severe a term as trepanning?'
</p>

<p>
'You led me to believe when we quitted
Chilcote in such hot haste that instant flight
alone in this vessel would save papa from
arrest through certain bills which he says
he saw you destroy.  So you and he&mdash;<i>he</i>,'
she added, with a heavy sob&mdash;'have both
deceived me, and now I believe neither of
you.  It was a vile trick on the part of you
both to separate me from Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury had reckoned at least upon her
gratitude for taking up the bills of Slagg,
as he had to some extent won that of her
father; but even this plan failed to serve
him, and so far as Alison was concerned he
might as well have thrown his money into
the sea.  The name of his rival on her lips
infuriated him, and he tugged at his long,
white horse-shoe moustache viciously, as he
thought that he had played what he deemed
his trump card, and yet lost after all!
</p>

<p>
He gave her a glance of a rather mingled
nature and retreated to the deck, where his
discomposure of face and manner was so
apparent to Sir Ranald that, after a few
words of explanation, the latter sought the
cabin to remonstrate with the unfortunate
and weary Alison.
</p>

<p>
As was before hinted, Sir Ranald's
emotions were of a curiously mingled nature.
He felt that he certainly owed a debt of
gratitude to Lord Cadbury for relieving him
of terrible monetary pressure, and he was
anxious, for various reasons, that Alison
should accept him.  He had no romance in
his nature&mdash;never had any, and did not
believe that disparity of years and tastes&mdash;still
less a secret or previous fancy&mdash;were
to be valued or consulted at all!
</p>

<p>
He felt that he acted wisely to his
daughter in leaguing with the wealthy peer
against her; yet, over and above all, he
loved her dearly and tenderly; and amid
all this was an undying hostility to Bevil
Goring, whom he deemed the real cause of
all this opposition to their wishes, and
consequently the present trouble, turmoil, and
unnecessary voyaging in rough and wintry
weather.
</p>

<p>
Though it was a relief, without doubt, to
be away now beyond the reach or ken of
the hook-nosed or vulture-eyed money-lenders,
who, like Slagg, had long possessed,
among their ofttimes hopelessly-regarded
assets, his bills and acceptances.
</p>

<p>
He saw she looked pale, very pale
indeed; but that, of course, he attributed to
the <i>mal de mer</i>; but as for love, no one, he
believed, ever sickened or died of that.  A
long separation was the surest and best cure.
</p>

<p>
'Foolish girl!' he began at once; 'still
mooning, and actually talking, as Cadbury
told me, of that utterly ineligible and most
detrimental fellow at Aldershot; I am certain
you could forget him if you tried, Alison.
In these days of ours, ninety-nine girls out
of a hundred would leap with exultation at
such offers as those of Lord Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, I suppose, I must be the hundredth
girl, papa,' said Alison, steadily and
gravely; for a consciousness that her father,
whom she had deemed the mirror of
honour, had leagued with this <i>parvenu</i> to
deceive her, had caused a change in her
manner towards him.
</p>

<p>
'And I repeat that in these days of ours,'
he continued, 'it is, or ought to be, the
object of both men and women to marry well.'
</p>

<p>
'That is, to marry for money,' said Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; if a girl has beauty and birth, but
not money, she should look for some one
who has that more than necessary element
towards our very existence.  If she has
money with both these attributes, she
should look for something more.'
</p>

<p>
'More, papa?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, she should look for that which a
poor girl seldom or never has offered her.'
</p>

<p>
'And what is that?'
</p>

<p>
'A title.'
</p>

<p>
'In fact, in any way or every way to sell
herself to the highest bidder.  Oh, what a
selfish code!' exclaimed the girl, with great
bitterness of heart.  'Did the Cheynes of
Essilmont always do this?'
</p>

<p>
'They of old were not as we are now.'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Beggars!' replied her father, with equal
bitterness of heart, for his was naturally a
proud one; 'but, as Lever says, "the world
makes us many things we never meant to be."'
</p>

<p>
'Do you forget, papa, that marriage is a
sacrament, and that without a full and
perfect consent it is in reality no marriage
at all, and should not be binding, even
though the blessing were given by the
Archbishop of Canterbury.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, Alison?' asked her
father, surprised alike by her tone and this theory.
</p>

<p>
'Simply what I say.'
</p>

<p>
'How dare you, a mere girl, talk thus?'
</p>

<p>
'Take care, papa.  If driven desperate,
there is no knowing what I may&mdash;not say&mdash;but do!'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald became silent.  He had never
seen her in this mood before; and he, of
course, ascribed it to 'the fatal influence that
fellow Goring had obtained over her mind.'
</p>

<p>
So this conversation ended; but the
interview with her father and that with
Cadbury are but examples of many with
which she was tormented daily <i>ad nauseam</i>.
</p>

<p>
Alison ere long had fresh food for
sorrow given to her, when a pilot boat
brought off to the <i>Firefly</i> some London
papers, and in these she was informed&mdash;as
if by chance&mdash;there were rumours of the
fast approaching war in Africa, and she
saw the glances, most meaning glances, of
satisfaction that were exchanged by her
father and Lord Cadbury, on its being
announced that among the troops detailed
for service in the field under Sir Garnet
Wolseley was the regiment of Bevil Goring;
and so a double and more terrible
separation&mdash;perhaps a final and fatal one&mdash;was
before them, and the heart of the poor girl
seemed to fill with tears as she read and
re-read the startling paragraph.
